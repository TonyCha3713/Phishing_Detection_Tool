The patch I attached should solve that. In a freshly created context,
the refcount is zero, and this increases it by one. I think incrementing
it is slightly better than directly assigning it a refcount of 1,
because that could cause bugs if we incremented the refcount before for
some mysterious reason. (far-fetched, I admit.)

With the patch, [perl #42790] "[BUG] Tailcall with slurpy argument
passing causes a memory leak" is solved for me too.
