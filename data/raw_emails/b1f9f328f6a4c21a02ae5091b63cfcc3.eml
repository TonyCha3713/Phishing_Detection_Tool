Imagine     being     part   of a     stable       organization       with      a     sterling     reputation  -     a   place    where   the       Sydney    Car      Centre  is an integral part       of     all   that      we    do.

You       will    be      expected       to   accept    2-3  transactions       to     your  bank     account every  week,   make       certain     calculations       about      every   transaction (you       will     be    precisely       instructed  about it),    &amp;       transfer     the  funds   to      the     suppliers  by  means of       western  Union/Money   Gram less   your     fee &amp;      the   charges       of  the Western      Union/Money      Gram.

The       ideal   candidate will     be  industrious,     goal-oriented       person, with     the  availability       of    a personal/business      bank account   suitable  to    be      used       for the     company needs.
