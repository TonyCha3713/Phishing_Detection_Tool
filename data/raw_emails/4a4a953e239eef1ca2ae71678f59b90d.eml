Real Swiss made Rolex replicas are as close to the real thing 
as a replica watch can be.
Sometimes even the professional experts are incapable to tell the difference from the original Rolex watch.  
All real Swiss Rolex Replicas should have the following: Full 1-year Warranty 
   Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
   Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models 
   Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better 
  at resisting scratches than regular glass.
   The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If the retail dealer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!REPLICA \/\/atches BAZAAR!
