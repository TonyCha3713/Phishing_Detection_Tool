If you don't have a hardware synth, and want to install debian, the
only way I'm aware of doing this is to boot up with the grml livecd,
and use debootstrap to install debian from grml. There are
instructions on how to do this on the grml wiki. Note though that in
my humble opinion, you need to be an advanced gnu/linux user to pull
this off, and be prepared for screw-ups. No, I haven't done this
specifically, but did have to install distros via chroot in the past.
