I'm asking that that be the default, that we create exactly one test
environment for the vast majority of the tests we run. =20

Sure, I think that the 'none' environment makes perfect sense.  That
doesn't change my position.

No, then the tests will constantly differ from the environment in which
they are normally run, even worse than the current situation.

I'm afraid that the selftest setup is becoming too complex to reproduce
- I want to be able to easily reproduce any failure in 'make
testenv' (which you will recall is my primary work tool), without first
wondering 'oh, what environment did it declare, what environment did it
get, and what environment do I have now'.

It doesn't seem too much of a price to always have a simple network
running, that contains the DC (or 2), and member servers.  Then we can
be very consistent in how our tests run, and are debugged.=20
