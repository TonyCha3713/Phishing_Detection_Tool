The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

I'm really just raising the discussion.   I think we just
need agreement.  We have too much code reformatting (based
on personal preference) in our patches.   There's been a
loose agreement on formatting in the past and I've never
been a big fan of Coding Style rules.  But as we try to
expand the developer pool, an unspoken agreement is insufficient.
