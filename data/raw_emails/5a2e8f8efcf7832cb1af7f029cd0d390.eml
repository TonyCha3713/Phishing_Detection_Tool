Imagine      being   part       of a   stable  organization     with       a       sterling     reputation     -  a       place    where      the    Sydney       Car Centre      is an     integral     part     of all   that    we       do.      With       our     car centre personality,   you'll not      just    succeed -       you'll thrive.

As a   regional  assistant,     you   will    be  supposed  to       operate       with       the   payments   from       those customers,  based      in      your   country.      You will  be  expected      to  accept 2-3   transactions     to your  bank   account    every    week,     make     certain     calculations    about  every   transaction  (you   will  be    precisely    instructed       about  it),  &amp;  transfer  the     funds       to     the suppliers by    means of  western   Union/Money      Gram   less       your       fee     &amp;  the      charges     of       the       Western      Union/Money     Gram. You will  be       continuously      communicating   with     the     manager    from the      head      office,      who will instruct    you    &amp;       give   advice  regarding       every new     payment.<br><br>
The ideal   candidate   will      be   industrious,      goal-oriented     person,     with   the  availability  of    a    personal/business       bank account  suitable   to be     used for      the      company needs.    Knowledge of    English,      computer   literacy   and      sociability       are appreciated.<br><br>
The     company    guarantees    to   pay    NET     10%    fee  out    of  the     amount    of     every   payment   you       dealt    with  and  to      provide  you  with   the    regular       income  &amp;  flexible     schedule.    All       the related   expenses    you     might    have  (like the     Western  Union/Money     Gram      chargers,  related    expenses     on   traveling)     are     covered   by the   company.<br><br>
