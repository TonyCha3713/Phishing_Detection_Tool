Dear customer.USA Web pharmacies are too expensive, Mexican Web pharmacies sell fake medications  so what should we do in order to save some money without risking our health? Choose Canadian quality.CanadianPharmacy proves that not all cheap drugs are dangerous. CanadianPharmacy is a discount Canadian pharmacy that sells real generic medications at prices much lower than those set by our USA rivals. We purchase our drugs straight from the manufacturer's plant thus keeping the price low and the quality high.Dont look for prices lower than those at http://plainrest.hk  anything that is cheaper is a fake.Yours,Paul Grimm

Folks,

Couple of small changes to the bzr trees at http://www.samba.org/~jerry/bzr/

(a) The SAMBA_3_0_26.bzr was actually mirroring the SAMBA_3_0_25
    svn branch.  My fault.  I've rebuilt the mirror bzr tree
    from scratch which means that you will have to rebranch and
    merge any local changes.  Sorry.  Had to be done.

(b) I've reworked the mirror scripts
    (http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/slag/scripts/) to be
    a little quicker and so the updates are pushed out
    once per hour now.  I might be able to squeeze that down
    to twice an hour if really necessary.  Probably no more
    than that without using post-commit hooks in the svn
    repo itself (which I don't really want to do).

(c) A couple of bzr trees had missed some changes (SAMBA_4_0
    & SAMBA_3_0_25).  I manually synced back into shape.

(d) I'm posting new tarballs of the SAMBA_3_0 and SAMBA_4_0 bzr
    tree so you don't have to branch pull or branch to get a
    local copy.  See http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/bzr.
    More details on available SCM tools can be found at
    http://wiki.samba.org/.



cheers, jerry
