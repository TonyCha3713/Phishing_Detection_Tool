Ok

Well I am having fun with ADSL now at the moment. I had gotten the
full package from eircom and elected to take the Zytel Prestige 645M
(that M is very important) But alas I cannot get it to work even with
another Major and popular graphical OS. So after almost 8 hours onto
adsl support trying to conince them that they did actually supplu and
support the 645M and not just the 643 and 645R its still not working.
So, after all that I am going to try a poweredge to connect and if
all else fails I will wait till Eircom send me out a replacement ( I
am going to have to look for the Alcatel this time :-) But while I
was doing my googleing I came acroos this

http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/how-to-connect.txt
http://www.roaringpenguin.com/pppoe/

And they look very cool for the beginner. Also the is a cool article
on www.linux.ie about USB and ADSL with PPPoE on Linux. ANyhow when I
do get it working (either with the 645 MMMMM or something else) I
will put up a howto but really the above is quite cool.
