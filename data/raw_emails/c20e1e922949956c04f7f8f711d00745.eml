Tridge,

You know I'm going to say this, but I respectfully disagree. :-)

I don't want to start any flame wars on style so this is
all I will say on the subject, but IMO all of your points 
imply that autogenerated headers are better because they
support bad programming habits.  Autogenerated headers are
easier for one programmer to develop but they are harder
for other programmers to use. Proto.h is a compiler workaround.
It does not make Samba development easier for anyone else.

Maybe I'm just immature and don't know any better....
But I will tackle this on my own time, in my own tree and
propose changes when and if I have working code to compare
against the SAMBA_4_0 build/proto system.  For now, this
appears to be a dead issue.

Sorry James.




cheers, jerry

You find it as soon as someone tries to use it.

Programmer error.

programmer error.  And besides that, all code suffers from
this.  It is not specific to header files.
