The  University of Notre Dame  is a Roman Catholic institution located in Notre
Dame, Indiana, immediately northeast of South Bend, Indiana, United States.
 Notre Dame,  meaning  Our Lady  in French, ref the University of Notre Dame is
often not pronounced the French way of , but rather .  ref  refers to the
Blessed Virgin Mary. The original and official name of the school is The
University of Notre Dame du Lac  Our Lady of the Lake . Notre Dame s picturesque
campus sits on 1,250 acres  5 km    containing two lakes and 136 buildings.

The school was founded on November 26, 1842, by 28 year old Rev. Edward Sorin,
CSC, and six Holy Cross Brothers who were members of the Congregation of Holy
Cross, founded in Le Mans, France, in 1837. Recent historical study has shown
that the Potawatomi Indians, partly because of the strong faith of Leopold
Pokagon, also played an integral role in the founding of Notre Dame both before
and during Sorin s presence in Northern Indiana. ref   ref 

The University s Roman Catholic character is physically manifest throughout the
Notre Dame campus. The Basilica of the Sacred Heart is centrally located on
campus. A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary stands atop the Main Building s
dome, there are chapels in every residence hall, and crucifixes in most
classrooms on campus. 82  of the student body self identifies as Roman Catholic.

The Indiana General Assembly granted the school its charter on January 15, 1844,
under the name  University of Notre Dame du Lac . While the translation of the
French is  Our Lady of the Lake,  the university actually has two lakes on its
campus. According to legend, when Father Sorin arrived to found the school, it
was November and everything was frozen. He thought there was only one lake and
named the university accordingly.

Location


The university is located in north central Indiana about four miles  6 km  from
the Michigan state line and north of South Bend, Indiana.

Government

University government is headed by a body of twelve self perpetuating members
called  fellows.  Six of the fellows must be priests of the Congregation of Holy
Cross  CSC , and the remaining six fellows are laypeople. Three of the priest
fellows are always the current university president, the provincial superior of
the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross, and the local superior
of the congregation at Notre Dame. The chairman of the board of trustees is also
always a fellow. The rest of the fellows are selected for staggered six year
terms. The fellows meet at least annually and are competent to amend the
university s statutes and bylaws and to elect and remove trustees. The board of
trustees is much larger than the fellows and currently numbers fifty seven,
composed mostly of laypeople. The board meets tri annually and is responsible
for electing the officers of the university as well as exercising the rest of
the corporate powers of the university.

The university president is responsible for the overall administration of the
university and is ultimately</STYLE>
