But I want to inform you that I have successfully transferred the Cheque

the course of the transaction I want to compensate you and show my

StatesDollars) in addition to your lottery winnings of $2.5m now amounting
to $3,000,000.00(three million United States Dollars).

I have authorized the finance house where I deposited my money to issue
you International Certified Bank Draft cashable at your bank. My dear
friend I will like you to contact the finance house for the collection of
this international certified bank draft.
