That is the idmap_ad case where it is easy for the idmap
backed to determine the SID type.

It is the fact that the *default* winbind setup (using
tdb, rid, or ldap) requires that the idmap child call
back into the winbindd parent to get the SID type so
it knows what to do.  This is a layering violation.

The caller asks the idmap backend to give it an id
but the backend the asks the caller to tell it
what type of SID it is.  If this is needed, then the type
simply must be specified as a parameter or else we
will be tracking deadlocks in every idmap backend
implementation we have.

The problem was that the design was built for a specific
case and not the general case and is therefore not sufficient.

That's debatable.  Right now, I'm considering the cache that
would require no change the the idmap interface, just how it
is used.

An example mapping on SID to uid would be as so.  The
caller fills in these values:

	sid_copy( id.sid, sid_to_translate );
	id.xid.type = ID_TYPE_UID;

Then the backend only fills in the id.xid.id field if the SID
does in fact resolve to a uid.

In most cases I've considered for the caller already knows
the SID type so this is no additional burden.

This would be the bare minimum fix for 3.0.25.  3.0.26 would
change the idmap API but as there are no external consusmers
other than winbindd, this should be easy enough.
