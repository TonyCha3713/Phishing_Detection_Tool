I'm still not convinced that any type of autogenerated
headers is a good thing.  I'd like to give James the chance
to experiment some.  Maybe we'll come to the conclusion that
the mechanisms used in the SAMBA_4_0 tree is appropriate,
but I would like come to that conclusion myself rather
than just accepting it on blind faith.

James, after some thinking perhaps it would be better
to work on this in a bzr tree until it matures a little.
How would you feel about that?




cheers, jerry
