First, are you using bzr for source control?  This would be
helpful in reviewing your patches.

If you need more details on using bzr with Samba svn trees,
See http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Using_Bazaar_for_Samba_Development

What is the password length ?  I'd assume it is some derivative
of the the NTLM hash (it not the hash itself).

Something is off with the parsing functions.  Specifically the PDU you
are sending.

It's generally very accurate although I remember having to flesh
out a few places where the svcctl calls were wrong.

The handle is always 20 bytes.  Can you send me a packet trace
to point out what you mean here ?

Some rpc PDUs always have the string.  Others use a 32bit pointer
to indicate whether the string value is present or not.  These two
instances (a UNISTR2 and a UNIST2R2*) are parsed differently.
