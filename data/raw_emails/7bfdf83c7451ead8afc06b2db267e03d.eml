 Anatrim made me take a step up.

 I feel as fit as a fiddle now and there are lots of men following me=20=
with their eyes!"

Lusia R., Bellevue WA

"I tried some passive weight reducing, but to no purpose. I could not=20=
restrain my ravenous hunger. 

One day I heard on Anatrim in the media and I rather liked the=20=
information.

 I had attempted taking it, and my wife said that I had changed for the=20=
better since then, 5 months later. 

28 pounds off and this is not a limit! 

And you know, I=92m an impetuous lover again."
