PS, I have to share this one last thing with you because 
this is so amazing. My brother and my own mother both tried
this bulk jackpot and won big, My brother won $4600.00 the
first time and $9,000.00 2 weeks later. My mother last night
won her first Jackpot, it was $8700.00 She was even playing
on their money when she won and cashed out the profits.
This is just amazing ... http://nedugasro.com/micro/7/
