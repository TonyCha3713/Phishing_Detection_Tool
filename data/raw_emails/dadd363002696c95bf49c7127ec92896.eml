Vmware with windows as the host works rather well. Serial ports just
work, since speakup isn't taking them as under linux. The disadvantage
is that windows is very unstable, to the point of needing to be rebooted
every cupple of days.

If you run vmware under linux and emulate windows, the windows at least
for me was sort of slow. Also, sharing between the two operating systems
will be an issue - either way. Samba can help with that, or windows file
sharing on the windows side.
