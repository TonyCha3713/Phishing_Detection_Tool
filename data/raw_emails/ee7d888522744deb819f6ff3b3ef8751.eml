Hi Geremy,

The latest version of speechd-up in gentoo is set up to handle this and
could use some testing.  To get it, do the following:

echo app-accessibility/speechd-up >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge speechd-up

Then add speechd-up to the default runlevel.

Please report bugs to http://bugs.gentoo.org.

Thanks,
