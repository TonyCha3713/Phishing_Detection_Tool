Why don't you try using freedos, and boot into it directly? That way,
you'll be able to do whatever you want, all under native dos, on your
physical box, not an emulated box. Also, you can run freedos as a
livecd, meaning you don't need to install on to your hd in order to
use it.

Also, the fact that you can't use your dectalk isa card under dosemu
isn't because linux is protective of the hardware. It is simply
because dosemu as far as I know, never has, doesn't, and probably
never will have the support necessary to address isa/pci cards and the
like directly.

Finally, the fact that you see different files when running dosemu as
a normal user and as root is no surprise, since in all likelihood,
you're running separate machines as each user. Think of it this
way, you have 2 physical computers, pc-a, and pc-b, which both have
dos installed. When you're running dosemu as a normal user, you're
using pc-a. When you're running it as root, you're using it as pc-b, a
separate machine from pc-a. Hth.
