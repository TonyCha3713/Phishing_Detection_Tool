Dear valued member.
This letter is a part of the official program initiated by the United American Health Department  please, read it to the end if you regularly buy drugs on the Web.
Its not a secret that many Web pharmacies are trying to make profits by selling fake drugs that not only prove to be totally useless but also can cause serious health problems. USDrugs is one of very few Internet drugstores that always offer only 100% generic meds.
Hope that you will find the information provided useful.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.

Nothing prevents test environments for guaranteeing both a dc and two
members will be up, for example.

If we have just one test network (with lots of hosts), then for example
"make test TESTS=TALLOC" will be very slow, whereas it is very fast at
the moment (doesn't need to do any provisioning). Same goes for tests
that only require a dc.

Also, the current code makes it very easy to add support for other
targets (Samba3, for example) that don't support all test environments
(yet).

Perhaps you would simply like to make sure that all test environments
are set up in 'make testenv' ?

Cheers,

Jelmer
