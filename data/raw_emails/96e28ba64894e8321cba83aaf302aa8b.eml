Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.








Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes referred 



to as impotence, is the inability for a sexually active male to obtain 



and sustain an erection for sexual purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for


 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 


and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment


 options available 

until very recently.
