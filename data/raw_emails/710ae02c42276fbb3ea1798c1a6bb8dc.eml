Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!

Hi Jerry,

Note: that in samba4 we start from the same code base (samba3)
And a took a lot of steps to come to the current system
(which hasn't reached it's last step yet!).

I think for samba3 the first step in this direction should be
to restructure the code into subsystems and removing the
autogenerated headers should be one of the latest steps
and not the first one.
