One day I was told about Anatrim the media by and I rather liked the information.

 I had tried to use it, and my wife said to me Im not more a weighty man now, 3 months later.

Thanks.

If you feel comfortable enough with it, I'd rather just drop
the selectable backend option.  We might leave it in for testing
but I would like to avoid it in the final 3.0.26 release.
It can take so long to remove parameters from smb.conf once
they are in released version.

What do you think?




cheers, jerry
