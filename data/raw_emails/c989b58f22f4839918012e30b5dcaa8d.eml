It's an ad library that launches a thread, and in that thread, it
checks that given websites are up. The websites they check for are
well-known ones that I guess will nearly always be up... providing the
phone has access to Internet. So I'd guess indeed, this is just a way
among others to check if an Internet connection is up.

I haven't check the sample for other parts, but at least, I confirm
that Pekin's university IP address is only being used for that.

Using androguard:
z = dx.tainted_variables.get_string('http://162.105.131.113/')
z.show_paths(d )
