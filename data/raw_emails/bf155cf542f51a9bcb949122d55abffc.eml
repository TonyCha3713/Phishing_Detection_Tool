What off topic posts are you talking about? I don't recall having seen
any off topic posts recently.

As for the ubuntu/orca/newby questions posts, this still deals with
gnu/linux. As far as I know, Kirk's policy has always been that
anything gnu/linux related goes. Unless Kirk has changed this
recently, all the recent ubuntu/orca/newby posts would seem to be
along those lines. Now, if Kirk has changed this recently, then you'd
be right that this is OT. My apologies to Kirk of course if anything
I've said here is out of line.
