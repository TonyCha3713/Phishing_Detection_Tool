Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.





Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 



to as impotence, is the inability 

for a sexually active male to obtain 


and sustain an erection for sexual

 purposes. In the past, this has been 


very embarrassing for men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 

and, in fact, there has been very
 little diagnostic testing or treatment



 options available 

until very recently.
