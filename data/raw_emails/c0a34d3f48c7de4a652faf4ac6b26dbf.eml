I just realized why this won't work.  On some platforms
the @SONAMEFLAG@ just becomes '#' and comments out the remainder
of the line.

SO this is good:

  SHLD_DSO = $(SHLD) $(LDSHFLAGS) $(DSO_EXPORTS)

but you have to add the @SONAMEFLAG@ last in the list
I still like moving the major and minor numbers of the
Makefile thought.  What do you think?



cheers, jerry
