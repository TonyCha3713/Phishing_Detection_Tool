Dear valued member.
Its your therapists assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
There are so many online drugstores on the Web today  but not all of them are as reliable as one might want them to be. Actually, only a few of them (for example, USDrugs) sell 100% generic meds  so you have to be really careful while choosing where to buy your pills.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.
