Real Swiss produced Rolex copies are as close to the real model 
as a copy watch can be.
Not always even the professional jewelers are incapable to tell the difference from the real Rolex watch.  
All original Swiss Rolex Copies should have the following: Full 1-year Warranty 
   Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
   Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models 
   Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better 
  at resisting scratches than regular glass.
   The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If the retailer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!Copy Watches BAZAAR!
