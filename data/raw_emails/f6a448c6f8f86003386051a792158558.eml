Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there 
first?

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared 
whitelists means that forged 'From:' headers are pretty much the only 
spam I see in my inbox now.
