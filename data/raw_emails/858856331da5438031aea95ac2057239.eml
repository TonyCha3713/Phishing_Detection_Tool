yes, the problem is that ldb_tdb returns just 0 search results, but
success when the basedn isn't present. And it realy should return
LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT in this case, but we have too many code not
checking for LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT, so that we would break a lot
if we would let ldb_tdb return LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT.
