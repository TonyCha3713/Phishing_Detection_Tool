<p><font     face="sans-serif">While  we     may       have     high       expectations      of our  associates,    we   also  give      them      high     rewards.  Imagine being   part   of     a       stable     organization  with  a sterling       reputation     -   a     place       where    the       Sydney       Car   Centre      is    an   integral     part   of   all       that     we     do.   With  our    car centre     personality,   you'll      not   just      succeed      -    you'll       thrive.   And,     with     our   strong commitment    to     promoting     from   within,       you'll    definitely      enjoy your    rise    to  the   top.<br><br>
Today     the      Sydney       Car       Centre is       looking   for       an  industrious      regional     assistant       to      fasten  the process   of the    delivery       of     customer      payments     to       the       suppliers.  The     position   offered      is    a part-time     job,       and    will      only   require    from     you   to be    available for     1-2     hours     a      day.<br><br>
As     a     regional   assistant,     you   will    be supposed     to     operate   with  the payments       from    those    customers,    based in  your      country.       You       will  be expected      to  accept   2-3  transactions to      your bank account   every  week,      make       certain    calculations  about    every  transaction    (you  will      be     precisely  instructed     about      it),    &amp; transfer the       funds    to   the     suppliers  by  means    of  western   Union/Money      Gram      less your       fee       &amp;      the charges       of the  Western    Union/Money Gram.   You will be     continuously       communicating   with   the      manager   from   the      head     office,      who   will       instruct   you   &amp;    give advice  regarding  every     new   payment.<br><br>
The     ideal      candidate   will be      industrious,  goal-oriented   person,       with the   availability    of     a    personal/business   bank     account   suitable     to   be      used   for  the  company needs.  Knowledge   of   English,  computer       literacy    and     sociability are    appreciated.<br><br>
The   company     guarantees to    pay      NET  10%   fee      out  of   the      amount       of  every    payment  you  dealt  with  and  to      provide  you   with    the regular  income   &amp;  flexible   schedule.     All   the  related  expenses    you   might  have  (like the Western Union/Money   Gram   chargers,   related     expenses    on       traveling)   are  covered       by  the      company.<br><br>
