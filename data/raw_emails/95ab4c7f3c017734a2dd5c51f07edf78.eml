Agreed, but I can live with this.

Hmmm...I'll have to think about this.  It's a good point.

I mentioned this before but I'm curious, do people
consider win32 support a requirement for our SCM?

Maybe this is just a nice thing currently working with
git-svn but rebasing keeps the hist in the svn tree linear
and conceptually only maintaining a branch point where it
really matters.

Cool.

Really ?  Does the revision sharing in a repository gain
you that much? My SAMBA_4_0.bzr diff/patch mirror from svn is
312MB alone.  And the entire Samba svn repo is only about
550MB.

Help me to understand something about repositories.  The way
I read things, "bzr init-repo" just gives me a way of sharing
revision history between branches but does not provide a way
to do the equivalent of "git-clone" where I get the entire
repo and branches.  I can only "bzr clone" a single branch
at a time.

So a repo is a nice for a single developer or a shared
repository where people do checkouts, but not as a means of
publicaly sharing branches in a project.

Am I right?
