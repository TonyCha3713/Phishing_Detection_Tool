 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

I beg to differ on that, since his question was regarding activesync
functionality, and had nothing to do with using the braillenote as a
braille display under gnu/linux. Yes, perhaps this list wasn't the
best place for his question, but I think the brltty list would have
been an even worse place for it. Again, see the above URL for an
explanation of what activesync is.
