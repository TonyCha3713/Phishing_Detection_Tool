Folks,

I just grabbed the latest copy of SAMBA_3_0_25 and this is
what will be come 3.0.25rc2 (with one minor bug fix I've yet
to add).  So any checkins to the 3.0.25 branch will not make
it into rc2 and possibly not into the final 3.0.25 release
unless they are extremely high quality, obvious fixes
with low risk.





cheers, jerry
