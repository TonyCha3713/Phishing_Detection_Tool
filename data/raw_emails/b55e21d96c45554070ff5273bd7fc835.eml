Thanks for that. I did forget to mention that I tried to have the
cdrom as the second drive from an iso, but I didn't try booting from
it. I actually wanted to see first how a windows/dos boot floppy would do,
thus the floppy boot, but I might bite the bullet, and try booting a
debian install iso directly. Also, my purpose in keeping wineyes
running was to have access to the qemu monitor, though it sounds like
you're saying that won't be accessible, which is too bad. 

I may try it again, though it probably won't be soon. Thanks also for
your offer of answering additional questions, I may take you up on
that if I need to when I try this again.

Greg
