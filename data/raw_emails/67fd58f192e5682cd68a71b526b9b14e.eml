Hey Derrell,

But *you* did not merge it into SAMBA_3_0_25.  This has
been a long standing policy and IIRC not the first time that
you failed to merge your own fixes.  I've mailed the list
several times when the release branch was sync'd with
SAMBA_3_0_25.  You have to realize that if you don't check
you code it, it would not be in the 25a release.

btw...the only tree that is actually locked is
SAMBA_3_0_RELEASE.  The SAMBA_3_0_25 may be temporarily
frozen but what that means is that I'm not pulling in
any more changes from that branch currently.

ok.  Fine.  I'll take it.  In the future, please merge your
own changes.   The strategy is straightforward:

SAMBA_3_0_25 		-> Samba 3.0.25 series
SAMBA_3_0_26		-> Samba 3.0.26 series
SAMBA_3_0		-> research or works-in-progress

I'm not planning any bulk merges between SAMBA_3_0 and
SAMBA_3_0_26.  I might do some house cleaning but don't
depend on it for inclusion in the release.



cheers, jerry
