Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?

Thanks
