Dear Customer,

Our robot has fixed an abnormal activity from your IP address on sending e-mails.
Probably it is connected with the last epidemic of a worm which does not have patches at the moment.
We recommend you to install a firewall module and it will stop e-mail sending.
Otherwise your account will be blocked until you do not eliminate malfunction.
