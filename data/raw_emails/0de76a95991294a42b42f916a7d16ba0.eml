Hi Jerry,

can you also explain, how you used git-svn?

I just noticed it's important to use exactly the same svn url
as you've used to get the same git sha1 hashes for a commit.

I used:
git-svn init -t tags -b branches svn+ssh://svn.samba.org/data/svn/samba
git-svn fetch

(notice when using svn+ssh://svn.samba.org/home/svn/samba, you'll get
different results...)

how do you managed to only have the interesting branches instead of all?

do you use git-svn dcommit ? If so it would be interesting what the
workflow is to commit from back to svn from a local feature branch
