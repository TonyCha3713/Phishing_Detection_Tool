You got my followup mail right (in reply to Volker and you)?
I like not changing the default behavior, but it is probably
less confusing (IMO) to just force the winbindd_rpc methods
than to tweak the flags in the winbindd_domain struct.  I believe
that was Volker's preference as well but you can double check
with him.

> Is the parameter name ok? Better as a non-parametric?

I prefer the parametric in this case (I think).


cheers, jerry
