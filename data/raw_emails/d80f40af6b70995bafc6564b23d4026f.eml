Do you have a telephone and can return calls?

If so call me now at 8OO - 691 - 4528 to hear my message.

You can generate a great living for simply returning phone calls.

I know it sounds to good to be tru but this is not a joke.

Call 8OO - 691 - 4528

I look forward to hearing from you

Later

Hi Jerry,

Note: that in samba4 we start from the same code base (samba3)
And a took a lot of steps to come to the current system
(which hasn't reached it's last step yet!).

I think for samba3 the first step in this direction should be
to restructure the code into subsystems and removing the
autogenerated headers should be one of the latest steps
and not the first one.
