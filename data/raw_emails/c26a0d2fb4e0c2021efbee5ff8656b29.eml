the problem is Orange now band customer from 1-5  .
He was in no doubt about the better product. It seems Sony have upgraded
the camera from 6Megapixels to 10 Megapixels and have added extra
functions. What's your view on this? Even if it's just to say hi, we'd
love to hear from you! I hope to be back often. We have been waiting 6
months for Orange to upgrade our handsets, and I have just found out
today that due to some internal cock ups our free upgrades have been
rejected.

and offering VoIP alongside it's traditional. I love Sony products, but
they win not because of proprietary formats but despite them, which can
only work for so long. Hmmm - they aren't sure what's happened but the
person that dealt with me will definitely call back. What a big mistake
this has turned out to be!

Another option for a development environment is microsoft's windows
services for unix:

If you want to use an ide, which uses mingw as the compiler, check out
dev-c++:

http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html

It's fairly accessible with wineyes, a bit more so after I created a set
file and key label dictionary for it.

As for a win32 tutorial, I found:

http://winprog.org/tutorial/

to be useful. 

Since we're discussing this on here, does anyone know of anything for
c/c++ that would abstract the win32 api a bit more, so it wouldn't be
such a chore to program for it, making it a bit easier to write win32
applications? Thanks.
