Weight is a major problem everywhere.  Many people battle the bulge every day and hope that they will find a diet that works for them.  However, you don't need a fad diet to lose weight.  You don't need expensive gym memberships either.  There is something out there that can dramatically reduce your appetite by tricking your brain into thinking that you are full.

People eat for lots of different reasons, hunger isn't the only one.  There are many reasons why people resort to food as a comforter but old habits die hard.  What if I were to tell you that there is a simple way to lose weight?  A way that, the television favourite, Oprah herself claims to work!  Want to know what she recommends?

Cosmetic surgeries and diets are quick and easy ways out but they also have side effects that can't be avoided, not only that but the bills from surgeries are astronomical!  Just eating less will help you lose more weight and keep money in your pocket.  Harder said than done?  Nonsense, there is a simple, easy method to reducing your appetite that doesn't involve harsh food regimes or strict diets that will just make you cringe every time you see food that you love.  If you want to eat what you always eat but still lose weight and feel great then click below.

Also, I doubt the kernel console approach would work with a usb to 232
converter, unless the debian netinst iso loads up the drivers for
those as part of the boot process. Even if it does, the debian
installer is dialog based rather than being command-based.
