- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

You can still install gentoo you just need to use one of the previous
livecds such as2007.1 or even one of the earlier ones such as 2006.1.
All a new release with gentoo means is a new set of livecds and more
current stages. Long as you've got internet access you can still
download a current stage.

Also nothing says that gentoo won't pick up the  fixed speakup patch and
put it into 2.6.22 once it's fixed.

I think the main reason it got dropped is because 1, gentoo wants to
keep moving forward, this means a more current kernel and it can't do
that with patches that break the kernel.
