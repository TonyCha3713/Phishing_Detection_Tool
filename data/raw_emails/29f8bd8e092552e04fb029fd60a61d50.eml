>From mercy ibeh,

Good Day my dear,

I am Madam mercy ibeh, from Ivory Coast. I am a widow being that I lost my 
husband a couple of months ago. My husband was a serving director of the 
Cocoa exporting board until
his death . He was assassinated last january by the rebels following the 
political uprising.

Before his death he had a foreign account here in Cota d'Ivoire the sum of 
Ten
million,five hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$10.500,000) left in 
one of the leading
security company. which he ditinguished and deposited with a security vault 
in Ivory Coast for the importation of cocoa processing machine.

I want you to do me a favour to receive this funds to a safe account in your 
country or any safer place as the beneficiary. I have plans to do investment 
in your country, like real estate and industrial production and I am going 
to take it as my personal task to assist the
widows like me.

This is my reason for writing to you.Please if you are willing to assist me 
and my only son James, indicate your interest in replying soonest.
Thanks and best regards
Mrs mercy ibeh,
