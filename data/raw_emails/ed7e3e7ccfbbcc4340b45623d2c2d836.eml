This patch copies the context to a new interp->fromc_result_ctx field on
a set_returns.  As far as I know no new tests fail with this. This patch
retains most side-patching (comments etc.) by Jonathan.  It also tests
in Parrot_free_context whether you want to free a context that is on
front of the free list, which would generate weird bugs.  There is a
test case for this bug in t/op/calling.t.

Alek, I made the bulk of the patch before I dug through the other mails
and saw your mail.  I'm sorry if you were still planning on sending it.

Thanks,
Bram Geron
