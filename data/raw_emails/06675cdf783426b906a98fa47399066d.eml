				Chase account from a foreign IP address and we have
reasons to believe
                that your account was hijacked by a third party without
your
                authorization. If you recently accessed your account while 
                traveling, the log
                in attempts may have initiated by you.<br>
                <br>
                However if you are the rightful holder of the account, click on 
                the link below and submit, as we try to verify your account.

                We ask that you allow at least 48hrs for the case to be
investigated and
                we strongly recommend not making any changes to your
account in that
