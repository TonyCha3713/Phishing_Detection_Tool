- - Take care to buy a laptop with a touchpad that is *not* leveled with
the surface, but slightly lower. (So you won't touch it accidentally)

- - Take care to buy a laptop with a touchpad that is *centered* below the
letter 'b'. (So you won't touch it when you type with 10 fingers.)

- - Take care to buy a laptop that has a touchpad with palm and
multifinger detection that works on linx. (So even if the above fail it
won't shoot your mouse into nirvana)

My thinkpad has all these features, that one would think are a must for
any laptop. I know quite a few other brands that don't follow those
rules, and not following these rules is one of the reasons why so many
people deactivate their touchpad and use an external mouse.

NB: My first unbranded laptop bought in 1999 didn't have palm detection,
but followed at least the other rules. I don't want to know how later
generations of laptop designers could get the idea of putting a leveled
touchpad right or left of the center position in a way it is unavoidable
to touch it while typing.
