http://odin749.blogspot.com/2007/05/longhorn-server-and-ubuntu-active.html

  Microsoft have just released Longhorn Server Beta
  3 which offers a fairly big change from previous
  windows server versions in the way it approaches network
  management with a large focus on role based servers.
  There real question however is can linux boxes still
  join and authenticate against Active Directory domains
  running at Native Longhorn Server levels. Well the answer
  a non surprising NO!
