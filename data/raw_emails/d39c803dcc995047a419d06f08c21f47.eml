Martin,

I don't understand why this would be necessary.  In
nt_printer_publish() we set the memory ccache again.

I also don't understand why the kinit() in ads_sasl_spnego_bind()
is failing.  It seems to me that the existing ds_kdestroy()
in check_printers-Published() is correct and that we should add
one to nt_printer_publish().

What am I missing?





cheers, jerry
