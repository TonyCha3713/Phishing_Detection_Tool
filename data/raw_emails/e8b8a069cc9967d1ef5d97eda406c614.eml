It's been a couple of weeks since my previous update regarding test
infrastructure progress. Here's what's happened since:

= Test coverage =

Code coverage in Samba 4 is now up to 41.4% and with a bit of luck and
some more work, we'll be able to get close to the targeted 50% before
SambaXP.

Pretty much all tests in Samba4 are now run as part of "make test", but
some of them are marked as known failing. If you don't know what to work
on, the file 'samba4-knownfailure' in Subversion should give a good
indication of things that need fixing :-)

= Test environment =

Support has been added for different "test environments". At the moment,
the supported environments are:

 * dc - A domain controller (the only environment that existed previously)
 * member - A domain member joined to a domain controlled by Samba4
 * none - No server whatsoever (used for local tests)

The member test environment is new and should be ideal for testing
things like spoolss callbacks and winbind.

It should be easy to add a "2dcs" environment for testing trusted domains.

= Backporting to Samba 3 =

The selftest code in Samba 4 supports running against both Samba3 and
Samba4 (all the version-specific code is in separate files), which makes
sharing this infrastructure code between both branches easier.

It is also much easier now to test with domains that contain both Samba3
and Samba4 hosts.

Cheers,

Jelmer
