Not necessarily true.  When the share is defined to include %a
in the path, the profile data is still separated by client OS.

[profiles]
        preexec = /etc/samba/scripts/create_profile %U %a
        path = /data/smb/c/profiles/%U/%a
        comment = Roaming user profile storage
        create mask = 0600
        directory mask = 0700
        profile acls = yes

[profiles.V2]
        copy = profiles
        browseable = no
