Hi, it's Sue. 
 
My friend Alice found a way to not be obese. 

She also found that in less than 4.5 minutes, you could get the information to be well on your way to changing that problem:

Good Luck,
Sue

Hi Ronnie,

can you also add this to libcli/util/doserr.c so that
win_errstr() displays it...
