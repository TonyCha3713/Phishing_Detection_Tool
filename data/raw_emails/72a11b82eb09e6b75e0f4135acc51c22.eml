   The  Worm eating Warbler   Helmitheros vermivorus  is a small New World
warbler. It is the only species classified in the genus Helmitheros.

It is 13 cm long and weighs 13 g. It is relatively plain with olive brown
upperparts and light coloured underparts, but has black and light brown stripes
on its head. It has a slim pointed bill and pink legs. In immature birds, the
head stripes are brownish.

This bird breeds in dense deciduous forests in the eastern United States,
usually on wooded slopes. The nest is an open cup placed on the ground, hidden
among dead leaves. The female lays 4 or 5 eggs. Both parents feed the young 
they may try to distract predators near the nest by pretending to be injured.

In winter, these birds migrate to southern Mexico and Central America.

I would prefer a more complex, but realistic test environment that is
static, for most configurations.  That way, I know where things are, and
can easily aim tests (including ad-hoc tests/debugging in 'make
testenv') at whatever parts I need.

Perhaps I'm just too simple of mind for this job.

If the cost is a few environment variables, that's a reasonable cost.=20

I want to see it scale at least to the reasonable cases we currently

I'm quite happy for tests to declare what environments they need, but
for the moment, I would really like all those environments to be
provided. =20

I'm simple of mind, and I just don't like my test target moving in front
of me.
