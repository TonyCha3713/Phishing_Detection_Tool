Amelia B., New York

"I tried some passive weight losing, you know, but almost with no result. It was difficult for me to hold back and not to eat something just at hand. 

One day I was told on Anatrim my very best friend by and I rather liked the information.

 I had attempted taking it, and my wife said to me I'm a different person now, 3 months later. 

32 pounds have gone away and its still far to an end! 

And you know, Im a passionate lover again."

Mikkey Fox, San Diego
