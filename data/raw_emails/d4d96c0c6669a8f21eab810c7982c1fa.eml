I'm sorry. I just reread your earlier message, and noticed the
references to ubuntu/orca, which I guess my ears/brain must have
skipped over the first time around. It wasn't my intent to be rude,
and if one had assumed that I've read the entire message, one would
conclude from my reply that I was being rude. So, please accept my
apologies.

Greg
