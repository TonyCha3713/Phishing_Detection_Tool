"I tried some passive weight burning, but with little result. I could not restrain my ravenous hunger. 

Once I heard on Anatrim in the commercial and I was really effected by the information.

 I had tried to use it, and my wife said to me that Im not more a weighty man now, 3 months later. 

28 pounds have gone away and I keep still losing them!

Nope.  Just coded internally to the DC lookup routines
used by smbd and winbindd.  Also generates private
krb5.conf files used to enforce server affinity
at the krb5 clientlib layer.
