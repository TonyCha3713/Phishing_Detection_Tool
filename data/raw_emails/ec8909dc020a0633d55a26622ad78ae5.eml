Here is a patch bundle

auth_util.patch		Revert create_local_token() to
			the 3.0.24 codebase

idmap_type.patch	Have the caller fillin the
			id_map.xid.type field when
			resolving a SID so that if we allocate
			a new id, we know what type to use

winbindd_api.patch	Remove the WINBINDD_SIDS_TO_XIDS calls
			from the public winbindd interface
			for the 3.0.25 release

idmap_rid.patch		Cleanup the idmap_rid backend to not
			call back into winbindd to resolve
			the SID in order to verify it's type.


This has been compiled but not tested.  Just posting for
review so everyone knows what the proposed solution is.



cheers, jerry
