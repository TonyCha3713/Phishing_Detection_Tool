 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Guenther, If this was to allow name2sid to resolve a UPN, you
need to be careful since the cache name2sid method will store
the forward and reverse mappings when you really only want the
UPN -> SID mapping stored and allow the SID to always resolve
back to DOMAIN\name and not name@REALM.
