All,

I am having difficulty figuring out how to set the speech-dispatcher
settings for  GenericVolume and GenericRate for espeak 1.25.

The rate isn't as big of a deal because the mapping is pretty close --
the default for speech-dispatcher maps to 160 which is 10 wpm slower
than the espeak default.

The volume, however, is way off.  Espeak's volume range is 0 to 200 with
a default of 100, and speech-dispatcher is from -100 to 100 with a
default of 0.  I have attempted "GenericVolumeAdd 100" and
"GenericVolumeMultiply 100", but that did not seem to work.  Does anyone
have any other suggestions?

Thanks much,

- --
