Vmware with windows as the host works rather well. Serial ports just work,
since speakup isn't taking them as under linux. The disadvantage is that
windows is very unstable, to the point of needing to be rebooted every
cupple of days.

If you run vmware under linux and emulate windows, the windows at least for
me was sort of slow. Also, sharing between the two operating systems will be
an issue - either way. Samba can help with that, or windows file sharing on
the windows side.
