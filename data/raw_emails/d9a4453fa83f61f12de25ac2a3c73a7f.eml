"I had problems with over-weight since I was a boy. 

You can't even fancy how I detested being ridiculed at school. 

I hated my plumpness and I abhorred myself. 

After trying this and that I found out about Anatrim. 

It literally took me out of this fearful nightmare! The warmest thanks to you, guys."

 
Steve Burbon, Colorado

 
"Do you know what? Anatrim kept my marriage intact! I got into the circle, depression  more eating  even more depression. My wife was about to leave me as I was turning in overweight psycho. 

Once one of my friends showed me web page and I asked for pack of Anatrim right away. 

The result was splendid, my appetite came to acceptable level, I was in a good mood oftener, and, of course, I went some belt holes back. And you know, the bedroom became cool, too!"

"of" was a typo

Unbreakable would mean here that no one, even previously authorised entity, 
could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of "trusted hardware" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.
