You've mentioned being used to debian twice now, though you're using
slackware. You are aware of the fact that there is an unofficial
netinst iso for debian which includes speakup, right? I'm not trying
to convert you back to debian or anything, but I thought I'd mention
that, in case you were under the impression that slackware is the only
distro containing speakup.
