Simo,

It's a little mind bending to swap from the centralized
workflow to a distributed workflow.  I'm not claiming to
have figured it all out, but see comments below.

The beauty is that there is no master tree. Everyone just
has their own tree.  Currently the svn model force feeds
changes to developers everytime you run "svn up".  The upside
is that there is an easy way to run top of tree.  The
downside is that people too often use "svn commit" as the
save button.  This is basically what svk tried to solve.

Using a DSCM forces individual developers to pull others
trees (which can be automated via cron jobs).  But by the
time the patches end up in the stable tree, they should
be well tested and ready to go.

The other advantage of using something like git is that
branch maintenance is reduced as individuals no longer
have to checkin to multiple branches.  The SAMBA_3_0_*
branches we have in svn will simply go away.  Of course,
the patch release model doesn't go away, but the responsibility
shifts.

I don't see any change here.  Instead of "svn commit && svn up",
you have "git commit && git pull".  This would also allow for
more of a maintainer model than we have now as well.

Anyways, I'm not proposing any changes at this time.  I plan
to spend the next couple ofmonths using git for daily
development.  If things go well, there's a string possibility
I will bring it up for discussion around the CIFS workshop
in Sept.





cheers, jerry
