But they never stay undocumented.  They become part of Samba
urban legends.

Please remove the option.  If we don't absolutely need
the parameter, then adding it is bloat IMO.

I don't think using tdb as a workaround for a bug
in ldb in this case is valid even as a temporary workaround.
Either we ship ldb or we don't.  Sorry for being so hard
nosed about it, but I fell very strongly about removing
the "groupdb:backend" option.

I will defer to the majority of course, but no one else
seems to be voicing their opinion.
