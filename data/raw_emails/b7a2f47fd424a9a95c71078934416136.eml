Nigeria.
Email: bisioloye@web2mail.com

Hello, 

I am Dr. Olabisi Oloye, a member of the "Contracts
Awards Commitee" in the Federal Ministry of Petroleum 
and Natural resources. Though constrained by inadequate 
information about you/company, I am establishing this 
contact with you based on the urgency and board's need 
for an individual/company who is willing to assist us with 
a solution to a money transfer and crude oil business, so 
please treat this proposal with absolute trust and 
confidentiality.

We have in control a total amount of $27.3m for immediate 
transfer to you. This amount represents the balance of the 
total contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which we the officials 
over-invoiced deliberately to pursue and shore up our 
political aspiration. However the actual sum of the contract 
has been paid to the contracted company who executed the 
projects.

Should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your 
share of the sum will be 25% of the $27.3 million, 65% for 
us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. Also we 
shall be very willing to assist you to register your company 
as a foreign contractor to NNPC to enable you do business with 
us legitimately. On receipt of your positive disposition towards 
this course, I would then bring you into the complete picture of 
this risk and hitch free transaction. 

Endeavor to send me your response on receipt of this
mail to the email above, as the processing of a
Confidential telephone and fax line solely for this
purpose is underway and details of same would be
donated to you as soon as we secure same. 

I await your immediate response and hope you will look
favourably on my proposition. 

Sincerely, 

Dr. Olabisi Oloye.

I don't think so.  You have to have admin credentials
to do this anyways so we should trust you.  But I'm not
particularly tied to the current patch.    Just seems a
little redundant to me.  If others think a --force flag
is necessary, I'll go along with it.




cheers, jerry
