Ladies always giggled at me and even guys did 
in the public toilets! Well now I laugh at them 
because I took Xtrasize+ for 6 months and now my dick 
is much bigger than "average" size.

I bought them from this store... http://fastherbals.com

This is my fault:

/usr/ccs/bin/ld: Unsatisfied symbols:
   ldap_rename2_s (first referenced in libads/ldap.o) (code)
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

I expected this to break some hosts.  I'll work on it tomorrow.
