Never mind, that the thread is a few days old: back to list.

palm detection: the touchpad distinguishes a touch with a finger from an
accidental touch with the palm of your hand or something else and
ignores the latter. Only if I touch my touchpad with a finger or the tip
of the thumb, it moves the mouse, switches focus etc. but if I
accidentally touch it with my palm or the side of my thumb the contact
is ignored and doesn't disrupt typing -- very cool.

multi-finger detection: I can configure my touchpad so that tapping with
two fingers is interpreted as a middle mouse click, three fingers are a
right mouse click etc. Especially useful for touchpads without middle
mouse button.

I thought that all modern touchpads would offer these features, but
recently learned that this is not the case or that at least not all
touchpads have linux drivers that support those.

HTH,
Johannes
