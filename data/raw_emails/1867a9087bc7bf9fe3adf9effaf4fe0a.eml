 Restore your sex life, or just give it a little kick.

Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes referred to as impotence, is the inability
for a sexually active male to obtain and sustain an erection for sexual
purposes. In the past, this has been very embarrassing for men, and a source
of anxiety for their partners, and, in fact, there has been very little
diagnostic testing or treatment options available until very recently.

Viagra can help you!

I remember seeing this at least since 2.6.19, and probably earlier, it's
been like that for a good while. I always assumed it was a problem
with the kernel source itself, rather than the speakup patch, since I
never bothered running mrproper on a clean source, as I mentioned in
another thread here earlier. 

Since everything compiles and works fine anyway, I just ignored it,
and didn't worry about it, or bother mentioning it.

I don't understand why that the patching of speakup is causing this error when issuing the mrproper command.  Because the file named in the error isn't part of the tar ball in the first place.  The mrproper command doesn't produce this error until the kernel has been patched with speakup.  I've downloaded and checked out with fresh tar balls and the results are the same.
