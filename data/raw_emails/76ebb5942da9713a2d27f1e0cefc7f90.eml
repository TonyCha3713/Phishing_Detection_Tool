Thank you for magic things which I ordered for the first time. Meanwhile I could check the result of these tabs....unbelievable, they help just in that way I hoped they would do, and more than that, very impressive !! I think I will order soon the next portion. Again, thank you for the excellent service and keep up the good work!  Roy Peterson, Apalachin, NY

What extra command are you talking about, is it the swspeak you type
at the very end?

As for what it does, without having looked at the cd structure, I'd suspect
that the boot scripts check for the presence of swspeak on the
isolinux command-line, and prepare the system for software speech if
they find it, (I.E. configure the soundcard, play the wav files you
hear during and after boot, load the sftsyn module, ETC.). Again,
without having looked at the swspeak script you run after boot, I'd
suspect that it loads up speechd-up, and does whatever wasn't done
during boot, though I do wonder if what the swspeak script does
couldn't be done as part of the boot process, if swspeak is found on
the isolinux command-line, instead of having to run another script
after boot.
