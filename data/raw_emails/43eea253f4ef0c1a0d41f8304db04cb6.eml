Dear valued member.
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Hope that this letter would be useful for you, your friends and relatives.
