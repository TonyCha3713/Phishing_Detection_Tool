This torment passed away after I started taking Anatrim! 

God,

"Since the very childhood I was a bulky boy. 

Its difficult to imagine how I abhorred being ridiculed at school. 

I abhorred my plumpness and I detested myself. 

After trying this and that I learned about Anatrim. 

It literally dragged me out of this fearful nightmare! A plenty of thanks to you, guys."

 
Steve Doubt, Bellevue WA

 
"Know what? My marriage was saved thanks to Anatrim! I got into the circle, depression  eating more  just more depression. My wife had thought to leave the overweight psycho I was turning in. 

One my best friend pointed to your web site and I called for Anatrim at the time. 

The result was excellent, my appetite came to admissible level, I was often in a good mood, and, be sure, I tightened my belt with no regrets. And the bed became cool, too!"

Haven't tried it myself (my touchpad is centered below my keyboard, so
no danger of accidentally touching it), but try 'man syndaemon'. If you
run it without the -t option it should disable the touchpad completely.
