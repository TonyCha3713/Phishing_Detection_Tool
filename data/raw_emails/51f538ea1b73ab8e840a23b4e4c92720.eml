No it wasn't, but I am no longer as interested in macs as I was when 
they were PowerPC. I really only like OS X for the unix side of things, 
and the relative ease in porting to it. If I wasn't planning on working 
on future projects that had OS X ports, I would even be considering 
getting an Intel mac in the future.
