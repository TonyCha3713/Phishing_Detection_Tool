To listen to some devout people, one would imagine that God never laughs. Early in the morning, at break of day, in all the freshness and dawn of one's strength, to read a book --I call that vicious!
We worry about what a child will be tomorrow, yet we forget that he is someone today. The minute you start talking about what your going to do if you lose, you have lost.

The recommended solution for mapping domain groups on a

The net groupmap trick is semi-obvious but not dings against
you for not seeing it :-)
