Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.







Erectile dysfunction (ED), sometimes referred 


to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 

and sustain an erection for sexual


 purposes. In the past, this has been 
very embarrassing for men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 


and, in fact, there has been very
 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 
until very recently.
