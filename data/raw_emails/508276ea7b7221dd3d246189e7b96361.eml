Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.



Erectile dysfunction (ED), 


sometimes referred 
to as impotence, is the inability 

for a sexually active male to obtain 



and sustain an erection for sexual

 purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for
 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 

and, in fact, there has been very


 little diagnostic testing or treatment
 options available until very recently.
