When there is a tail call without parameters, the tail call frees the
caller's context without checking if it is referenced, e.g. by a
closure. The test in <parrot.tailcalltest.patch> fails in svn HEAD
because of this, but checking relies on the 'coincidence' that some new
allocated context is of the same size as the (incorrectly) freed
context. If some version of Parrot optimizes by default, the test might
succeed with the problem still there.

The patch in <parrot.solution1.patch> fixes the problem for me.

Why is the surrounding if statement (see below) there? If it was there
to detect that a closure was made and is now passed on to the callee, we
can remove it as it should not be necessary any more. That might fix
[perl #42790]: Tailcall with slurpy argument passing causes a memory leak.

317:                         pc[2] == PARROT_OP_get_params_pc))) {
