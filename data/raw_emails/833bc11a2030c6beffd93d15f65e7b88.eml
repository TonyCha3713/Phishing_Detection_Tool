In that case, you'll be prompted for those options when doing
config/menuconfig/oldconfig, and you'll be told that it's a new option.

Yes. If you're using a .config file that you didn't generate yourself from an older kernel to compile a
newer kernel, it's still fine to run oldconfig and get prompted for
any new options. However, after doing that, you should do
config/menuconfig, and verify the configuration. No, this isn't
redundant. Doing oldconfig gives you the chance to configure any new
options the way you want them configured, while doing
config/menuconfig let's you verify the configuration, without having
to worry that you might miss any new, and maybe important options. However, if your
distribution's kernel version matches the kernel version you're
compiling, I still think using the distro's .config will give you a
good starting point.

Agreed. It's too bad there isn't a script for linux that can examine
the hardware in a system, and generate a streamed down .config
specific to that system. One of the neat things about netbsd is that
there is a script that parses your dmesg output when running the
netbsd-supplied kernel, and then it generates a streamed-down kernel
config specific to your hardware.
