     Get Tan in One Day
 Celladerm? Self Tanning Mousse combines Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) a colorless 
 sugar that darkens the skin. Along with Gluconolactone a patented anti-aging element 
 to produce a formula that gives you the smooth, long lasting, streak free tan you want, 
 while combating the signs of aging skin.
 
 What is DHA?
 DHA or dihydroxyacetone is a colorless sugar that darkens the skin. DHA works together 
 with the dead surface cells found in the epidermis, or the outermost layer of the skin, producing 
 a color change. This is a harmless skin dye that reacts with an amino acid in the skin 
 to produce a temporary tan that typically lasts five to seven days with a single application.
 
 What is Gluconolactone?
 Gluconolactone a newly patented Poly-hydroxy acid, has shown in clinical 
 studies to have anti-aging benefits. 
 
 Other Benefits of Gluconolactone:
 
 - Improving skin clarity
 - Reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles
 - Enhancing the skins smoothness and elasticity.
