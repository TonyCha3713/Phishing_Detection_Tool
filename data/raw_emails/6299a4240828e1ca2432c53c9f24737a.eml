Indeed, and aside from the value in allowing a 'none' environment, and
possibly the Samba3 stuff, I'm yet to be convinced of the need for
multiple environments.=20

I just think it's getting too complex.  It used to be very simple, and
it isn't any more. =20

Well, the first point is that DC1 and DC2 *should* be sharing the same
username and passwords.  The member server will have additional local
users (to verify the local SAM), but the whole point of a member server
is to use the same passwords...

Provisioning for an additional DC should not be particularly expensive.
I expect to do some work to allow two DCs to share a ldb (for one modal
of replication), and for the DRSUAPI replicated case, we just need to
setup a skeleton.=20

I really don't understand what you mean here. =20

I don't mind having other environments, but I would much rather one
'test network' than the current fragmented setup.=20
