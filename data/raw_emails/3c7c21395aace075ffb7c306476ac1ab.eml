After being frustrated with a floppy half way through sex I decided to try 1/2 tablet of Viagra. I'm 54, 6'1", 158 lbs and work out regularly, but even that was not enough to keep me hard. But the 50 mg of Viagra did a miracle. I could have supported my whole body on my bone. It only took 15 minutes to start feeling a tingling in my balls and my penis starting rising in light heartbeat throbs. I stayed hard as long as I wanted to and only softened after ejaculation. Even then, after only a few minutes I was back up. The effects last up to 15 hours to some degree. I'm glad I got over my fear and went to see my Dr. about my ED and am forever thankful.

I  had been worried about loss of erection during sex over past year. Finally talked to family Doc -checked out OK for blood pressure etc-we decided to give Cialis a go. Stunned by the first time and subsequent results. A hard and lasting erection -plenty of orgasms for my lady-and surprisingly similar results next few days WITHOUT another tablet. 'Topping up' about once a week. Some nausea after, but a small inconvenience for the wonderful benefits.<br>
