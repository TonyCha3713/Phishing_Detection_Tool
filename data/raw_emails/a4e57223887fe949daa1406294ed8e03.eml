 Dear Friend,
 
 I am Mrs. KEVLYNE KOUMA from cote d'ivoire. I am a widow; I
lost my husband a couple
of months ago. My husband was the director of Cocoa
exporting board until his
 death. He was assassinated last January by the rebels
following the existing

 political crisis in our country. Before his death, he has a
private bank account
 here in Cte DIvoire with the sum of US$10.5 Million which
he told the bank was
 money reserved for the import of cocoa processing machines.
 
 I implore you to receive this fund into a safe account in
your country or any
 safer place as the beneficiary where it can easily be
invested into a business.
 I have plans to invest the money in your country in Liquid,
real estate or

 industry. Please, as you show interest to assist me and my
only son, do reply
 soonest by sending me your telephone number.
 Regards,

 MRS. KEVLYNE KOUMA
