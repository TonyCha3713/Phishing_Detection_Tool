Then one day, this system left me no option but to hate it and stand up in revolt against it. Mia was pregnant. She was facing a delivery situation. I rented a car to take her to hospital. We were both delighted. Everything looked fresh and new again. I hadn't yet reached the main road when two policemen stopped me. They told me that I couldn't go ahead. On my humble inquiry they told me that a member of the Politburo was to travel through this road so the passage was closed for general public. I informed them of my irresistible compulsion but they were earless. Justice is deaf in our part of the world. In response to my pleads, however, they had mercy on me enough to guide me to an alternate passage yet at the same time informed me that the road was under construction.


Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
