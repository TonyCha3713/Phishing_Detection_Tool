There is a pretty good deal going on at Office Max if you plan on 
upgrading to Windows XP Home or Professional: 
If you purchase XP Home (upgrade or full version), for $50 more you 
get: 
Kingston 256MB PC133 SDRAM memory module 
McAfee Antivirus v6 
Spectra Cool-Cam (webcam/low quality digital camera) 
If you purchase the Professional version (upgrade or full), for the 
same $50, you get all the above plus: 
HP Scanjet 2100c color flatbed scanner 
Hi-Val 12x10x32 CDRW 
Then, you get a $50 mail-in rebate (no matter which version you buy). 
 So you end up getting all that stuff for free just for purchasing 
Windows XP! 
My wife went in, asked about the offer, and a few minutes later, had 
the upgrade version of XP Professional and all that stuff for just 
$50, plus the mail-in rebate to get the $50 back!  Not bad...  Even 
if you already have a scanner or a CDRW, they would make great gifts 
too.  :) 
For more info, go to http://www.officemax.com  and click on the 
"Windows XP Exlusive 10-day offer" link on the right-hand side.  The 
deal lasts until 11/03/01.  So if you were going to buy it anyway, 
you may as well get free stuff too.
