Heads up,

I've now started or merged the beginnings of converting to
PIDL on the following pipes

  * winreg
  * svcctl
  * eventlog
  * lsa
  * wkssvc (already had this in 3.0.25)

The dfs, initshutdown, and echo server code has been merged
from SAMBA_3_0 in its entirety.  The samr and spoolss pipes
still need some work in either the IDL or pidl before we can
work on bringing over so for now, ignore them.  The netlogon
and srsvc code can be done using the proxy call mechanism.
I'll start on bringing them in next.

What I would like to see is for us to convert the remaining
calls one by one.  I suggest that any new calls *must* use
the pidl generated code.  There is no reason to hand write
marshalling code any more.

Thanks to Jelmer and Volker to all their previous work
and advice to make this an easier task.






cheers, jerry
