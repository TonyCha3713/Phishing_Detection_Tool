I lost my strength for a moment, but then the very next moment a well-acquainted voice resounded from the unfathomable vacant of my heart. Mia's voice. She asked me for such a favor once, but how innocently, not so professionally like her. Mia asked it for the comfort of her soul and she. Should I sacrifice Mia's sincerity over Tina's outwardly attraction? Should I forget all those innumerable moments spent with Mia for the sake of temporary pleasure? Should I betray Mia's blind folded trust for a selfish wish of mine? No. Never.

Our intention is to offer to only those interested. If not the mechanizim is in place for you to decide.
