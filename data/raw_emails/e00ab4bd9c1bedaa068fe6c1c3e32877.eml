Thanks.

If you feel comfortable enough with it, I'd rather just drop
the selectable backend option.  We might leave it in for testing
but I would like to avoid it in the final 3.0.26 release.
It can take so long to remove parameters from smb.conf once
they are in released version.

What do you think?




cheers, jerry
