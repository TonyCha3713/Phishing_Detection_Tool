And then in such compellingly disappointing conditions I found Tina. Even under these conditions she was full of life, breathing with all the energy. She wasn't very beautiful but she was definitely very attractive. So it was natural for me to take interest in her but what surprised me was that she attracted to me as well. I met her with reference of finding a job. She gave me the job and her company. I don't know why, even though she was married.
