I've done this:

git clone -n --bare git://git.samba.org/samba samba.git
du -sh samba.git
70M     .

git clone -n -s --reference ./samba.git/ git://git.samba.org/samba s3
cd s3
cat .git/objects/info/alternates
/home/People/metze/devel/samba/samba.git/objects
du -sh .git/
832K    .git/
git checkout --track -b metze-v3-0 origin/v3-0

git clone -n -s --reference ./samba.git/ git://git.samba.org/samba s4
cd s4
cat .git/objects/info/alternates
/home/People/metze/devel/samba/samba.git/objects
du -sh .git/
832K    .git/
git checkout --track -b metze-v4-0 origin/v4-0

then you should always run "git fetch" within samba.git
before doing a "git pull" within s3 or s4, this makes sure
you'll have the objects only stored under samba.git/objects/

you can also run the git-fetch via a cron job as it doesn't
change any working tree.
