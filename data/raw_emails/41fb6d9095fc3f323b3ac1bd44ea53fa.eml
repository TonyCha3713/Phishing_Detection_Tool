Oh boy. If I did that instead of being able to use oldconfig, I'd be
upgrading to my own kernel build every 3 years or so. When I want to
upgrade to a newer version, I take the .config from my existing
version, slap it into the new source tree, do make oldconfig, compile,
reboot, and bingo. The only scenario where this doesn't fully work is
when going from 2.2 to 2.4, and from 2.4 to 2.6. When I did that, I
still used oldconfig to take care of anything obvious (options marked
as new), but I did go through both times, and verified the whole
config carefully before compiling.
