Thanks, both what you and Alex said is very clear. I assume that once
you hit ctrl+g to interact with the vm, you can use normal speakup
review keys, and get speech from a serial hardware synth, assuming you
correctly redirected the virtual serial port to the machine's physical
serial port? Did you use ssh to do the install, because interacting
with the vm isn't as simple as I assumed in my previous question, or
was it simply because you just wanted to use ssh to do the install, or
because you didn't have a physical serial port/hardware synth?
Has anyone tried running gnome in a vmware machine running on a
windows host? If this is all as straight forward as it sounds, and as
good as it sounds, I may not have to worry about gnu/linux compatible
hardware, (I.E. modem, wireless card, on-board serial ports, ETC.), and about the
warranty if you resize partitions or remove windows, when looking for
a new laptop in the future.
