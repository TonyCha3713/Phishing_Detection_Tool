Assylum with my younger sister Glory Marah who is 16 years old. Now the war=
 in my country is over with the help of ECOMOG soldiers, the present govern=
ment of Sierra Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who served un=
der the former regime and now ask countries to expel such person at the sam=
e time freeze their account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note =

Yet another web site I needed to boot into windblows for to fully use,
(sigh). I didn't see it on the order page using elinks/lynx the cat. Sorry
