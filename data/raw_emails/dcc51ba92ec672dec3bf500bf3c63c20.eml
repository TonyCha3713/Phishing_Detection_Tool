The debian/Ubuntu packaging is IMO, rather woeful. It would have been 
much better to ask the license questions in the preinst script using 
debconf. As an Ubuntu packager, I do not endorce the packaging quality 
of the deb.

I would also think that offering a tarball download would make sense, as 
there are users of other distros here, such as Slackware. At this point, 
such users have to jump through hoops just to get the package 
installed.
