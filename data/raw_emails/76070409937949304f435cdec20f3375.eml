Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Hope that youve found the information provided in the letter useful.

A couple more comments, sorry about the double post. I did want to
point out that even though your friend hasn't changed her password, it
is possible that /etc/shadow and/or /etc/passwd got corrupted. Also,
in the correctly spelled second thread, someone suggested using single
user mode. However, as far as I know, you still have to login even
then, so that might not work.
