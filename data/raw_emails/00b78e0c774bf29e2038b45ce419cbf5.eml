Although repl1ca w4tches like T4g Heuer and Patek Phil1ppe are nowadays more common than ever, most people
who would want to buy one of these, have no idea where to obtain it. Purchasing a w4tch is a decision not
to be made lightly, even if the timepiece in question is a repl1ca. It is important to make sure that the
w4tch you are buying meets the highest standards, is equipped with a powerful and reliable mechanism and
bears all the markings of its genuine counterpart. And the only place that offers unmatched quality repl1ca
w4tches and exceptional customer service is Prest1ge Repl1cas. Thats the reason why thousands of savvy
internet shoppers are turning to Prest1ge Repl1cas to get the w4tch theyve been longing for.

Hi all.

Is it possible to include the speech-dispatcher/speechd-up/espeak
binaries in an initrd, so that one has speech almost as early as with
a hardware synth? If this is doable, and will provide speech
significantly earlier in the boot process, (especially if I were to
build alsa into the kernel itself), then could someone familiar with
how to work with initrds please describe the steps I would need to
take in order to accomplish this on a debian system? Thanks in
advance.

Greg
