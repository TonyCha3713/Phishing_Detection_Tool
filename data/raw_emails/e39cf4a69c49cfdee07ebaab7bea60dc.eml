Hi chromatic,

I'm not sure if it is really needed to extend this function. When I was
examining IO first I was not aware of the opportunities of the NCI. Meanwhile
I have written parrot-functions using NCI clib functions to handle
reading from programs (on UNIX platforms).

Have a look at readFromProgram* methods in attachment. Perhaps I should
add these in some way to the parrot runtime library.

If you think the first extension I wrote for PIO_unix_pipe() is still
useful, I will make the patch apply cleanly.

Regards,

Kiwi
