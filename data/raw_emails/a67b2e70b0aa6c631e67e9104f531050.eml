Dear Sir/Madam,

How are you doing? I would be very interested in offering you a part-time
pays venture in which you could earn a lot. I am Dr. Kay Molly and I am 57
years of age.

I just resigned my job as a scientific researcher at Asia Agricultural
research Institute in Malaysia and I now work as a freelance consultant
for the institute which positively grants me a lot precious time to do my
personal work which is mainly being a freelance researcher who could be
employed by research institutes to do research projects anywhere in the
globe.

Currently, I have just been granted a funding to head a research project
in the tropical regions of Asia regarding rare and vulnerable plant
species and this would be starting very soon.

This research program will be funded by some of my United State of America
and Canada counterparts and Associates. But the only set back is that my
associate wants to make payments for the research in form of a Cashier
Checks and Money Orders only to any of the USA and Canada.

Opening an account would have been my best decision but I have a deadline
to meet and taking any of those decisions would cost me time and a whole
lot of other essential requirements which I am not ready to deal with.

This is where I need to employ your valuable support and service.

WHAT I NEED YOU FOR?

At this point, I will be glad if you could work with me as my
representative in above named countries. You will be working as my payment
assistant in charge of accumulating the payments from my Associates.

in United State and Canada, you will be obtaining this payment and cashing
them on my behalf. On agreement to been my representative, you will
receive a commission of 10% of whatever amount of payment you receive from
my associates.

into your bank account. or in form of money orders/checks from my
associates via mail(UPS/FEDEX/DHL).
2. 	Cash the payments at your Bank.
3. 	Deduct 10% which will be your commission/percentage on payment processed.
4. 	You are to remit the balance via Money Gram or Western Union Money
Transfer according to my in depth mandate.

HOW MUCH WILL YOU EARN?

10% from each transaction! For instance: On receiving USD $100,000 on my
behalf, you will cash the payment and keep 10% to yourself before
remitting the balance! At the beginning your commission will equal 10%,
though later it will increase up to 15%!

ADVANTAGES

You don't have to go out of your present daily activity in order to engage
in this Job(i.e. You can do this Work easily without leaving or affecting
your present Job).You will work as an independent contractor right from
your home /office. Your permanent occupation is absolutely legal. You do

Hi Zachary. Have you tried booting anything virtually using Qemu under Linux? The last time I tried this by booting the test image I got no output, since Qemu was using SDL. I'm wondering if 
this is still the case if I were to say, try and boot an OpenBSD iso or something.
