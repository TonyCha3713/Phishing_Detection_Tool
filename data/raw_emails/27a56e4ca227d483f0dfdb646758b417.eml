					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Identity protection 
					matters. And <strong>PayPal<sup></sup></strong> works day 
					and night to help keep your identity safe. That's why it has 
					come to our attention that your <strong>PayPal<sup></sup></strong> 
					account information needs to be updated as part of our 
					continuing commitment to protect your account and to reduce 
					the instance of fraud on our website. If you could take 5-10 
					minutes out of your online experience and update your 
					personal records you will not run into any future problems 
					with the online service.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, failure to update 
					your records will result in account suspension.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once you have updated your 
					account records, your <strong>PayPal<sup></sup></strong> 
					session will not be interrupted and will continue as normal.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To login to your <strong>
					PayPal<sup></sup></strong> account and update your records 
					click on the following link:<br>
