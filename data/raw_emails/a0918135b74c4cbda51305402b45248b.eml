Cholera is spread by contaminated water and food. In addition, red blood
cells containing sickle haemoglobin do not live as long as the normal
120 days and this results in a chronic state of anaemia. Many
scientists, although not all, believe this process is linked to high
blood pressure, or hypertension, which in turn is linked to a greater
risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
"Banking" involves attaching the blood vessels of the amputated body
part to healthy blood vessels surgically exposed at another site - in
the case of the Samurai victim, the arm. This can lead to blockages in
the vessels, preventing oxygen from getting through to the tissues, and
causing severe pain and damage to the organs.
Most schizophrenic individuals are not violent; more typically, they
prefer to withdraw and be left alone. Though the illness usually begins
with one or more painless but highly infectious sores appearing anywhere
on the body (but usually at the site of infection) this is not always
the case. How is schizophrenia treated? Although news and entertainment
media tend to link mental illness and criminal violence, studies show
that mentally ill people are no more prone to violence than the general
public.
Reducing the temperature of the tissue helps to slow down its metabolic
rate, so that the cells can go without their usual supply of nutrient
and oxygen while detached from the blood supply.
Men and women are affected equally. Many people may hurt themselves
secretly for some time before they ask for help, often because of fear
and shame. The infection can be cured by antibiotics. There is no cure
for sickle cell anaemia.
It is also important to consult a doctor before considering strenuous
exercise, and particularly before planning to start a family. If
necessary the patient is given fluid, or even a blood transfusion. Set
up in 1993, the EHA works with other UN agencies and national health
ministries. Warts are found on or around the penis, anus or vagina. The
effects last for about eight hours.
Several cases report the drug being given to women without their consent
in order to remove their inhibitions. It also plays a central role in
the transmission of electrical impulses in the nerves, and helps cells
to take up nutrients. It is 10 times more potent. BBC News Online
provides details of the most common forms.
GHB is also known as  liquid X or g-juice, and was once sold in health
food stores to bodybuilders. Other symptoms include pain or difficulty
in passing urine. Similarly, a greater volume of fluid passing through
the heart can place additional strain on the organ, increasing the
possibility of coronary disease.
Experts suggest this may be because men find it easier to express
emotions like anger in an outward way or take it out on others.
Often displaced populations are forced to gather in confined spaces,
further enabling the spread of epidemics, such as cholera, malaria and
dengue fever.
However, the average intake of salt is between 9g and 10g a day. Organs
such as the liver, kidney, lungs, heart and spleen become damaged,
causing severe pain, especially in the bones.
Tests can also identify the haemoglobin type of a baby from about 11
weeks gestation.

Thanks for the patch for 3.0.25.  If the extensions are to be
dropped, it would have to be in 3.0.26.





cheers, jerry
