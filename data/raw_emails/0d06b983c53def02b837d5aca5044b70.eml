 Joseph Addison   May 1, 1672     June 17, 1719  was an English politician and
writer. His name is usually remembered alongside that of his long standing
friend, Richard Steele, with whom he founded [[The Spectator  1711 /The
Spectator]] magazine.

Life and writing

Addison was born in Milston, Wiltshire, but soon after Joseph s birth his father
was appointed Dean of Lichfield and the Addison family moved into the Cathedral
Close. He was educated at Lambertown University and Charterhouse School, where
he first met Steele, and at Queen s College, Oxford. He excelled in classics,
being specially noted for his Latin verse, and became a Fellow of Magdalen. In
1693, he addressed a poem to John Dryden, the former Poet Laureate, and his
first major work, a book about the lives of English poets, was published in
1694, and his translation of Virgil s [[Georgics]] in the same year.

Such first attempts in English verse were so successful as to obtain for him the
friendship and interest of Dryden, Lord Somers and John Montague  later Lord
Halifax, by whose means he received, in 1699, a pension of   300 to enable him
to travel widely in Europe the continent with a view to diplomatic employment,
all the time writing and studying politics. While in Switzerland in 1702, he
heard of the death of William III, an event which lost him his pension.  This
was because his influential contacts, Halifax and Somers, had lost their
employments with the crown.  He returned to England in the end of 1703. For a
short time his circumstances were somewhat straitened, but the Battle of
Blenheim in 1704 gave him a fresh opportunity of distinguishing himself. The
government wished the event commemorated by a poem  Addison was commissioned to
write this, and produced The Campaign, which gave such satisfaction that he was
forthwith appointed a Commissioner of Appeals in the government of Halifax. His
next literary venture was an account of his travels in Italy, which was followed
by the opera of Rosamund. In 1705, the Whigs having obtained the ascendency,
Addison was made Under Secretary of State and accompanied Halifax on a mission
to Hanover. In 1708 he became MP for Malmesbury in his home county of Wiltshire,
and was shortly afterwards appointed as Chief Secretary for Ireland and Keeper
of the Records of that country. Under the influence of Wharton, he was MP for
Cavan Borough from 1707 until his death.

He encountered Jonathan Swift in Ireland, and remained there for a year.
Subsequently, he helped found the Kitcat Club, and renewed his association with
Steele. In 1709 Steele began to bring out the [[Tatler]], to which Addison
became almost immediately a contributor  thereafter he  with Steele  started The
Spectator, the first number of which appeared on March 1, 1711. This paper,
which at first appeared daily, was kept up  with a break of about a year and a
half when [[the Guardian  1713 /the Guardian]] took its place  until December
20, 1714. In 1713 the drama of [[Cato  tragedy /Cato]] appeared, and was
received with acclamation by both Whigs and Tories, and was followed by the
comedy of the Drummer. His last undertaking was The Freeholder, a party paper
 1715 16 .

The later events in the life of Addison did not contribute to his happiness. In
1716, he married the Dowager Countess of Warwick to whose son he had been tutor,
and his political career continued to flourish, as he served Secretary of State
for the Southern Department from 1717 to 1718. However, his political newspaper,
The Freeholder, was much criticised, and Alexander Pope was among those who made
him an object of derision, christening him  Atticus . His wife appears to have
been arrogant and imperious  his step son the Earl was a rake and unfriendly to
him  while in his public capacity his invincible shyness made him of little use
in Parliament. He eventually fell out with Wilson over the Peerage Bill of 1719.
In 1718, Addison was forced to resign as secret</STYLE>

Hi all. I downloaded the checkout script from linux-speakup.org/pub/linux/speakup, so that I can attempt patching 
Speakup into Linux-2.6.21.5. However, when I run checkout I get the following:
Patching version v26
CVSROOT not set.  Enter it below.  Hit enter for anonymous.
CVSROOT>
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@linux-speakup.org:2401/usr/src/CVS
cvs login: authorization failed: server linux-speakup.org rejected access to /usr/src/CVS for user anonymous

Has the CVS username changed, and I'm just not aware of it? Thanks.
