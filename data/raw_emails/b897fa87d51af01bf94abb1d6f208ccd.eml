You'll be hard pressed to convince me that me2sid is an
unnecessary function since it is critical to the operation
of smbd.

Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  We would need to see numbers of both
a client implementation and a server implementation.  And you
need to be able to prove that a server with X number of
authentication requests per second works now and does not work
with this patch.  But even then, you can simply disable the
request with a setting in /etc/security/pam_winbind.conf
if necessary.   So for now, this debate point is purely speculative
and no reason to deny functionality.




cheers, jerry
