Yeah but that's not what I asked.  I know there are tools
for mDNS but does anyone admin'ing Samba servers care?
It's not so much a technical question as it is a popularity
vote.  If no one uses the feature, it will bit rot.  And
that would leave us in worse shape than having no mDNS
support at all.





cheers, jerry
