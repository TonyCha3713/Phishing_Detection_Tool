I'm strongly opposed to either change.  Mainly because
we are simply shifting the responsibility of who is
supposed to know what they are doing.  The original
intent of forcing winbindd to use the winbindd_ads
methods if possible was that the the solely rpc
methods would not always retrieve the data in a consistent
manner.

So rather than expecting the AD admin to know what they
are doing, we are shifting the burden on the samba admin
which is not really any better.

Perhaps if someone gave an example of how the AD install
was not working it would help to win me over.
