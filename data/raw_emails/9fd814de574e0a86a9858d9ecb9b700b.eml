You keep saying that, and this seems to be the reason why we are doing
this the current way.  But I really don't buy it - we are going to be
doing a *lot* more tests against the member server, so we will almost
always have to pay that setup price.

I also think that we can reduce that price.

That may be useful, but does not resolve my objection to the current
trend.

That's why I just want to set up a generally useful test environment
once, and run with that.  It can list 'provides: dc, member', if that
helps you keep track of what scripts require which parts, but I just
want one test network...
