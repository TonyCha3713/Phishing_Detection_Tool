Dear valued member.
Its your therapists assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
Its not a secret that many Web pharmacies are trying to make profits by selling fake drugs that not only prove to be totally useless but also can cause serious health problems. USDrugs is one of very few Internet drugstores that always offer only 100% generic meds.
Dont hesitate to contact us if you have any questions concerning the information provided.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.
