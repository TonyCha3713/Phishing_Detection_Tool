Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad  we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia  so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Take care of your health  use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

Nope.  I generally defer to Alexander or Jelmer on Docbook
issues.  Maybe they have an idea.
