The only added complexity would be that there isn't just 'testenv' but
'testenv-dc' and 'testenv-member', and there is just one test that
uses
the latter at the moment. That makes it a little bit more complex, but
the alternative is a complex test environment.

I also think the concept that a test has to run against a particular
kind of server isn't particularly hard to grasp.

Well, I was thinking of the case where two DCs were in different
domains
but had a trust between them. So, in the case of two dc's in the same
domain, you would have a $DC_USERNAME and $DC_PASSWORD but also
passwords and ips for various member servers.

Provisioning by itself is relatively slow. If I run "make test
TESTS=RPC-SAMR" a lot of times in a row when I'm trying to fix
something
it does matter that provisioning takes twice as long.

I also imagine we'll have a different environment that provides a
NT4-style DC. Eventually we may end up with a dozen or more
servers and that will cost us. It may work for just one dc and member
but won't scale.

At the moment, it is very easy to create a test network that contains
a
Samba4 DC and a Samba3 member server or a Samba3 DC and a Samba4
member
server, etc.

If we'd need to set up the same environment for a different target
(Windos or Samba 3), we'll have to replicate the exact same situation
including all the various different dcs/members before we can run any
of
the tests or we need to keep a list of targets against which a
particular test can run. In the current situation, we can simply skip
all tests that require an environment that is not available.

Cheers,

Jelmer
