 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Thanks.  I've still got ti finish unit testing the merged

back merges.
