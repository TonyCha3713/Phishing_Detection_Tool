As a result, hadnt his "serious fictionbecome steadily more self-conscious, a sort of scream? Why, that she didnt hold all the cards after all - that I had a certain passive hold over her.

Folks,

I'm going to go ahead and branch SAMBA_3_0_26 later today from
the current SAMBA_3_0_25 tree.  I believe that patch pressure
is getting high but maybe this is just from my own need to
start clearing out winbindd changes.

The reason I'm branching from SAMBA_3_0_25 and now SAMBA_3_0
is that we still don't want the CIFS data encryption work
that Jeremy is doing, not the full PIDL/libndr files.  These
are the only major features in SAMBA_3_0 that are not in
SAMBA_3_0_25.

Once the branch is done.  We'll have about 4 weeks of major
changes and then will start locking down for another release
approximately one month after the feature freeze.





cheers, jerry
