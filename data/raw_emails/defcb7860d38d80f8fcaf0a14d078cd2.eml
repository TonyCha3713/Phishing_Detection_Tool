Hey Gnitpick, James here,
I had to tell you about this great hook up site.
I joined it last Wednesday and I got laid twice last weekend
(by 2 different girls)
How cool is that? Its so easy and these babes want to hook up right away
with any guys they meet.
I'm tellin you, you will get some action. Check it out and see what you think.
I am sure you will be thrilled with results.
Oh I forgot to mention, 
it doesnt cost anything to join in the fun.
