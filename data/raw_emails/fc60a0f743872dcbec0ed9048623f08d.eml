 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Yes, wineyes does seem to have scrolling issues in text-based
programs. This is not only true in the command prompt, but is also
true with teraterm pro as well. However, my problem wasn't that I
wasn't seeing errors produced by qemu. I was certainly aware for
example of the error I got when it couldn't find the bios files.

Alex, thanks for the virtualbox suggestion. I hadn't heard of that one
before, I'll give it a look.

Greg
