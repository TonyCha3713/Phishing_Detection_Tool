Simo,

One possibility would be to basically swap the Fedora and
Debian responsibilities that you and I share.  This would
make more sense I think.  Then you would have complete
control over the Fedora packages posted to samba.org and I
would be able to dig into dpkg (which I've been interested
in doing anyways since I've completed the migration of my
servers to Ubuntu).

The 3.0.26 release might be a good swap over point.  Let me
know if you are interested.




cheers, jerry
