I just got a webcam and computer for my birthday and I just finished
my first homepage. I added some of my modeling pictures there so if you
think you can help my career please let me know. I could also use some
opinions on how to make my site look better. If you can't help and you know
someone that can, please forward them this e-mail. I need money and can sure
use the work. I just added my most recent set of pictures.

If you don't want to look at my pics,  I am 5'5 125, blonde hair, blue eyes
and I play volleyball.

Link to my site: http://63.107.112.67/profiles/julie20

Thanks,
Julie

Seems reasonable.  But there's a bit too much churn right now
in the idmap code for my taste to be this close to release.
This would have to wait until the next round.
