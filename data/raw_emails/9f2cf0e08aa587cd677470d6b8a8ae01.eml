Thanks.

If you feel comfortable enough with it, I'd rather just drop
the selectable backend option.  We might leave it in for testing
but I would like to avoid it in the final 3.0.26 release.
It can take so long to remove parameters from smb.conf once
they are in released version.

What do you think?
