> Hi all.
> 
> Say I want to get 2 files via ftp, but I want to do it in a specific
> order, and I don't want file2 to start downloading until file1 is
> finished downloading. For example, if I were to execute get file1.tar,
> and get file2.tar, I want get file2.tar to be executed only after get
> file1.tar is done.
> 
> I see that lftp has a queue command. Does anyone know if this would
> work the way I expect? What I mean is if I execute:
> 
> queue get file1.tar
> queue get file2.tar
> 
> in lftp, would that in fact wait to download file2.tar until the
> download of file1.tar was complete?
> 
> If the queue command in lftp doesn't work this way, then is there
> another command that would do what I want? If lftp can't do what I
> want, then can ncftp do that? If so, then how? I have looked through
> the ncftp man page as well, and this doesn't seem to be doable in
> ncftp. If neither lftp or ncftp can do what I want, then is there
> another ftp client for gnu/linux that can?
> 
> Just to clarify, I don't want to time-schedule the downloads, I simply
> want them to happen sequentially one after another, in a specific
> order, (I.E. file2.tar can download right after file1.tar, but it
> can't start downloading while file1.tar is still being downloaded).
> 
> On another note, does anyone know for sure if put in lftp or ncftp
> will retry an upload until it successfully completes, if the upload
> keeps being interrupted, say due to network issues? I'm fairly sure the
> answer here for both programs is yes, but I wanted to make
> certain. Thanks in advance.
