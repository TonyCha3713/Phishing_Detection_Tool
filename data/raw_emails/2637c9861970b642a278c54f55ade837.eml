Content preview:  Dear customer, Regions is constantly working to increase security
   for all Regions OnLine users. To ensure the integrity of our online payment
   system, we periodically review accounts. Your Regions OnLine account was
  placed on Identity Verification Status. Accounts are placed on Identity Verification
   Status when a certain time has elapsed since a Scotia OnLine customer hasn't
   updated his account information. Accounts that are verified continue to receive
   payments, but they are limited in their ability to send or withdraw funds.
   If a Identity Verification Status lasts for more than 7 working days, the
   Regions OnLine account will be locked. [...]
