Replica Watch
Why spend thousands of dollars on the real deal when
  a replica watch looks so much alike that only an expert could tell the difference...
  And you only pay a fraction of the price.

Folks,

I've sync'd up the 3_0_release tree as of SAMBA_3_0_25 svn r23107.
The plan is to spend the remainder of today testing and release
3.0.25a tomorrow.  So if you had a problem with the 3.0.25 release,
please test the release tree and let us know what is and is not
fixed.  There are many more open bugs of course and we'll catch
those next time around.

Note that the WHATSNEW.txt is current wrt commit logs in this
release.





cheers, jerry
