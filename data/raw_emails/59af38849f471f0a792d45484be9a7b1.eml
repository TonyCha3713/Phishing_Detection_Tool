More release planning:

How are people feeling about June 4 as the freeze for
major code changes in 3.0.26 ?  3.0.26pre1 is scheduled
for JUn 15 give or take a few days.

I'd like to keep a short release cycle on this one so
if you have work that is a bit off in the distance, the
3.0.27 will soon follow.




cheers, jerry
