try
git clone git://git.samba.org/metze/file-split.git

use gitk or
git log;
git show 9cdcb092
git show 4a7a25e9
git show 264de8c7

to see what happens in commits.

"git annotate file2.c" should show every line comes from 264de8c7

but now search for 4a7a25e9 within
"git annotate -C file2.c".

I really like that!
