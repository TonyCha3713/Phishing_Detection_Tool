I've installed everything from FreeBSD to Solaris to Linux in a vm, and
am getting quite good at it now. The one requirement is having a lot of
ram, since the vm's ram + however much ram the host needs is quite a
bit. With 768MB, it's not too bad - but it could be better. Also,
vmware's audio performance is - not so great. If you're just using ssh
from the window side, it's not that much of an issue - since you can
just play mp3s and such on windows.
Just my $0.02,
Tyler
