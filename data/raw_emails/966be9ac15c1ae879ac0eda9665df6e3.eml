In accordance with our Online Banking User Agreement, your account access will remain restricted until the issue has been resolved. </DIV>

Unfortunately, if access to your account remains restricted for an extended period of time, we will be forced to close your account as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes. </DIV>

We encourage you to log in to your Online Banking account as soon as possible to help avoid this.</DIV>
