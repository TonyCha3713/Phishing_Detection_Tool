My order arrived within one week in perfect condition. The pills are phenomenal! I only use half of a pill at a time, and sometimes the effect is still noticeable the next morning! I've even tried a third of a pill once (I didn't split it very well) and I still felt the desired effect. Thanks for good service and a great product! David Harvey, El Monte, CA

Does anyone know what they're doing about zipslack, since umsdos isn't
supported in 2.6.x? Are they dropping that too? I haven't used
zipslack/zipspeak for a very, very long time, but I was just
wondering. From a sentimental point of view, it would be sad to see
zipslack dropped, that's what I started out with.
