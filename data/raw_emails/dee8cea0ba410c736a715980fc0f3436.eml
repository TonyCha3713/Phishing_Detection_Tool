I personally feel, and I don't think I'm alone, that the rnd cost
recovery excuse goes only so far. True, rnd costs might have been an
issue in the beginning, along with the size of the market the products
are aimed at, but let's take for example the screen reader
manufacturers for the other popular os. With the kinds of prices they
charge, and given the large amount of sails they've most likely made
over their product's lifetime, I would have thought they've recovered
their rnd costs long, long ago, and then some. No, I think that what's
driving prices of A.T. for the most part these days is pure and simple
greed, not to mention that these companies' biggest customer is the
U.S. government, and that it has deep pockets to boot, from the
perspective of the companies.
