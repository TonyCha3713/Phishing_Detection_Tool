More and more people are getting concerned with the problem of fake drugs sold on the Web. This letter is aimed at helping you choose a really reliable Internet drugstore.
If you prefer shopping for meds on the Internet, remember three basic tips on how to choose a reliable e-shop:1)      the pharmacy should be well-known (for example, USDrugs)2)      it should be licensed3)      the drugs offered should be generic

I don't see a reason to use the libnss_winbind from
Samba 3 with winbindd in Samba 4.  The client and server
are two halves of the same coin.

A lot of this goes back to the discussion about using
IDL for the pipe protocol.  I've had to on several
occassions work to ensure that a 32bit libnss_winbindd
could communicate with a 64bit winbindd.  This is a
big pain.

There's usually a very good reason for the diffeences
in Samnba 3.  The pstring/fstring change is just to
support a list of group names rather than a single one.
Should be a marshalled string in reality but until we nove
to IDL, static sized structures are the rule of the day.
