I'm not altering the D-Bus API with this patch - it's just
some refactoring to put code in a better place. The Buddy emits a
GSignal 'disappeared' when it runs out of handles, which causes the PS to
emit BuddyDisappeared; this is as opposed to having the PS inspect the
Buddy to see if it has any handles left.
