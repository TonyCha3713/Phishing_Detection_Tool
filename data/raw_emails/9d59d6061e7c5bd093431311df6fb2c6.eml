This stuff is really great! After losing 33 lbs months earlier I hit a brick wall. I work out three times a week, 20  min of cardio and 21  minutes in the weight room. My two trouble zones just wouldn't budge. I did all the exercises I could think of to target them, but nothing helped! Then I tried Anatrim and everything changed! In just 6 weeks I lost the remaining 25 pounds. I always knew that couldn't be the thinnest I could get. I'm glad I found this product. I finally achieved the body I wanted. My husband says I look like a goddess
