Here's a rough patch for expanding domain group membership
in the winbindd_getgrnam() call.  Couple of comments:

* Adds "winbind expand groups" parameter which defines the
  max depth winbindd will expand group members.  The default
  is the current behavior of one level of expansion.
* The entire getrgnam() interface should be async.  I
  haven't done that.
* Refactors the domain users hack in fill)grent_mem() into
  its own function.

Comments?  I'd like to check this in for 3.0.26 as a
preliminary implementation for people that need it.



cheers, jerry
