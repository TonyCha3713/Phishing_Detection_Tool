ATTENTION.
We wish to notify you again that you were listed as a beneficiary to the to=
tal sum of $16,700,000.00(sixteen million seven hundred thousand United Sta=
tes Dollars) in Amsterdam,Holland to the intent of the deceased (name now w=
ithheld since this is our second letter to you).We contacted you because yo=
u bear the surname identity and therefore can present you as the beneficiar=
y to the inheritance since there is no written will.
We therefore reckoned that you can receive these funds as you are qualified=
 by your name identity. All the legal papers will be processed in your acce=
ptance. In your acceptance of this deal, we request that you kindly forward=
 to us your letter of acceptance; your current telephone and fax numbers an=
d a forwarding address to enable us file necessary documents at our high co=
urt probate division for the release of this sum of money.
Yours faithfully,
Hugo Deryuk
