So, in your patch it seems like we no longer support having a fixed
domain GUID (and therefore need to setup the DNS zone every time)?

OK.  I'll handle it that way for the short term.

I've been looking over your patch, and I'm still not comfortable with
the schema changes.  We should be able to extend our schema, so while
the unixName stuff should go away, we must be able to load something
else...

'@'unixName doesn't seem quite right at all.=20
