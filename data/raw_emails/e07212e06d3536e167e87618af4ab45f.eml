It seems you may be running into a similar problem which I reported
happens when switching synths with the doubletalk pc driver built into
the kernel, and set as the default. Try starting the system with none
as the default synth, and then loading software speech, starting with
the sftsyn module. If that works like it's supposed to, then it looks
like the ltlk driver has issues as well.
