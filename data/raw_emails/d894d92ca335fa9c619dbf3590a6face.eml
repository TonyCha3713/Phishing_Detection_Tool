Hi, I hate to be the one to mention this, but people 
at work are talking about your weight issue and it just 
disgusts me. Whether you know it by now, people are 
always chattering about each other at work but you come 
up more than enough. I feel the right thing to do is to let
you know now before this gets worse. I wasn't the happiest or 
best-fit a year ago or so but I managed to change that thanks to 
my sister-in-law(of all people). Anyhow, it was for the best. 
What I am saying is that you need to do something different 
and maybe you can make the same difference I did. Try this 
stuff I used. I took it on the idea it's just more junk but 
it worked great. I see more positive reviews on it nowadays 
and makes me feel even better. So, I am encouraging a change, 
not only in the chatter around here but in you personally if
you are willing. 

-Anonymous for now 
Here is the website below I order from.
