Hello, Hans

A tender flower is crying on the cold rain and blowing wind. It
needs protection... I feel like this now... Cover me with your warm
hands and kiss me with your tender lips and I will be yours... If you
are looking for something, if your heart misses something important...
write to me... my heart is lonely... let them meet... http://myhearthwithlove.com/likes

Looking forward to get a letter from you

J.K.
