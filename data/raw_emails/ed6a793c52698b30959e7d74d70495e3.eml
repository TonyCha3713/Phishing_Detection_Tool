The names are confusing but "windows nested groups"
implements the NT4 model of local groups (e.g.
BUILTIN\Administrators).  The "winbind expand groups"
patch unrolls nested domain groups.

For example, suppose the dodmain global group
DOM\outergroup has 2 members: user1 and innergroup.
DOM\innergroup is another domain global group with
one member: user2.

Before this patch, "getent group DOM\outergroup" would
return:

  DOM\outergroup:x:10000:DOM\user1

If you set 'winbind expand groups = 2' (to unroll
up to 2 levels of nesting), you will get

  DOM\outergroup:x:10000:DOM\user1,DOM\user2

This is useful for Unix applications that need check
if a user is a member of a group using NSS.

Come to think of it, I'll probably have to do some more
work to get domain group unrolling to work with machine
local groups.
