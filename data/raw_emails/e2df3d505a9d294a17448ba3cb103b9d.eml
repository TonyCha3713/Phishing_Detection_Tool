I would really like to see the parameteric options
moved out to the relevant individual man pages.
For example, IIRC volker add the "rpc only" option
to winbindd(8).  The ldapsam options should be
moved to a pdb_ldapsam(8) man pages (once we have one).

Please revert this from the gargantuan smb.conf(5). :-)
Thanks.



cheers, jerry
