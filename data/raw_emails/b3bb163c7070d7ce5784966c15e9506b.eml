Prof. Rains Marve,
# 41 Easton Street,
London WC1X 0DW, UK

Attn;

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not 
meet. I am Prof. Rains Marve from United Kindom, Personal account officer to 
Late Dr.George Brumley. I contacted you to kindly assist me in the proposal 
below, which will be of mutual benefit to us both.

Dr. George Brumley died in July 19, 2003 and he has an account deposited 
with well known bank here in london and since his death nobody has done 
anything as regards the claiming of this money because he has no family 
members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds 
apart from me. The dormant account with holding balance of 43,000,000.00 
(Forty Three Million British Pounds) which has not been operated for the 
past years is floating and if nothing is done to remitte out this money 
urgently it will be fortified by the government.

Being the account officer that signed and indorsed the deposit papers for 
the deceased.It is my responsibilty to trace the family relatives of the 
deceased so that the funds will be released to them. I made several efforts 
though the Kenyian High Commission to contact any of the deceased family 
relatives, but to no avail, and I have decided to contact you to act as the 
next of kin by assisting in repatriating the money in his account. The Bank 
has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin within the next 14 
official working days or the account declared unserviceable and confiscated.

This business is simple. All I require is your honesty and co-operation to 
enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed 
under legitimate arrangements, from your response, I shall then provide you 
with more details that will help you to understand the transaction more. 
Observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction 
would be most profitable for both of us.

I look forward to your urgent Response,

Best Regards,
Prof. Rains Marve.
