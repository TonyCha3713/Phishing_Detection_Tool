Hi Simo, hi Jerry,

I'm currently syncing samba3' and samba4's lib/tdb/ directory.
One of the major differences is that samba3 has tdbback.[ch]

There's only one user of backup_tdb() in samba3, it's
nsswitch/idmap_tdb.c. It would be nice if I can remove that one.
As we should backup all persistent tdb's before upgrading
or none.

So my plan is to move the lib/tdb/common/tdbback.c code into
lib/tdb/tools/tdbbackup.c and make the functions static.
Then I'll sync samba 3 and 4.

Comments please:-)
