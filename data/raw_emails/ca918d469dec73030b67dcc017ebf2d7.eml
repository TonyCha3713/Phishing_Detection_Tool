Want the degree but cant find the time





Want the degree but cant
find the time?



WHAT A GREAT IDEA!

We provide a concept that will allow anyone
with sufficient work experience to obtain a fully verifiable University Degree.

Bachelors, Masters or
even a Doctorate.

Think of it, within four to six weeks, you
too could be a college graduate.

Many people share the same frustration,
they are all doing the work of the person that has the degree and the person
that has the degree is getting all the money.

Dont you think that it is time you were
paid fair compensation for the level of work you are already doing?

This is your chance to finally make the
right move and receive your due benefits.

If you are like most people, you are more
than qualified with your experience, but are lacking that prestigious piece of
paper known as a diploma that is often the passport to success.

CALL US TODAY AND GIVE YOUR WORK

EXPERIENCE THE CHANCE TO EARN YOU

THE HIGHER COMPENSATION YOU DESERVE!

Hi Andrew,

I just noticed the cli_credentials struct used by the winbind service in
the member server has some double elements under it. Maybe this is the
problem why we always do a new AP-REQ for each connection and the in
memory ccache doesn't work correct...

Can you take a look at this please?

struct cli_credentials  contains  502 bytes in 20 blocks (ref 5)
   struct gssapi_creds_container  contains 4 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   LOCALMEMBER3$@SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM contains 32 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   struct ccache_container  contains 20 bytes in   2 blocks (ref 0)
      reference to: struct smb_krb5_context
   struct creds_CredentialState   contains  68 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 1)
   struct gssapi_creds_container  contains   4 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   LOCALMEMBER3$@SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM contains 32 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   struct ccache_container contains 20 bytes in   2 blocks (ref 0)
      reference to: struct smb_krb5_context
   struct smb_krb5_context   contains   8 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 2)
   LOCALMEMBER3$           contains     14 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM       contains     18 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   SAMBADOMAIN             contains     12 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   cK4nOr,K                contains      9 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   (&(flatname=SAMBADOMAIN)(objectclass=primaryDomain)) contains 53 ...
   SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM       contains     18 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   LOCALMEMBER3            contains     13 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
