Papertowels fall apart, but ZorbEEZ has the durability to get the job done. Coffee, soda, or even red wine, ZorbEEZ soaks spills up in seconds and holds up to 20 ounces of liquid.

ZorbEEZ's amazing x27 material draws liquid out of carpet making it 27 times more absorbent than cotton. Unlike sponges that stink, Zorbeez is odor free. Plus, it's machine washable, so you save money. Use  ZorbEEZ to dry your dog or cat, wash your car, wipe away fingerprints, clean windows with streak free shine, and so much more.
