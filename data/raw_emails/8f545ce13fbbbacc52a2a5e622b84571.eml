Hi all. Afaik the driver was fixed in an earlier kernel release; however, when I attempt to boot the kernel, I get no 
speech out of the express. I'm thinking the rest of the boot process went fine (or somewhat close to that), since I 
heard a lot of disk access shortly after I would have started hearing speech. Has anyone gotten this driver working in 
2.6.21.5 as of yet, or is it still fu and bar? Thanks.
