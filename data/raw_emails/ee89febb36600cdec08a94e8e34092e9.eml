I've posted an updated version of my 3.0.24-gc dev branch
to deal with the break in "force group" caused by the
CVE-2007-2444 patch and backported the Vista related bug
fixes from the Samba patches page.

The bzr branch is hosted at
  http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/samba-3-0-24-gc.bzr/

The source tarball is available from
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/people/jerry/3.0.24/

The Fedora Core 6 RPMS have been uploaded to
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/Fedora/

This is it *not* an official release from samba.org and therefore
has been signed with my GPG private key (ID D83511F6). If you don't
want to make the jump to 3.0.25 just yet, this 3.0.24 based snapshot
might be just for you.




cheers, jerry
