Is it possible to keep it?  It did work rather nicely for switching out
exactly the things that the LDAP backend provided.=20

Also, what is stopping us from keeping the additional schema items?  Do
we not know how to generate the prefix mapping table?  We should be able
to extend the schema...

Could you commit the easy parts of this now, while we work on the rest?
(like removing instanceID, aggregate schema generation)?
