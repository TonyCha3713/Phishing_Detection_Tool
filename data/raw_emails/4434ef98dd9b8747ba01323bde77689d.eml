Mainly I've found getpwnam() and getgrnam() to be the main
offenders due to the fact that the first thing we do to service
the request is to try to convert the name to a SID.

The code path for getpwnam() converts the name to a SID
and then call winbindd_getpwsid().  The winbindd_getpwuid()
converts the uid to a SID and then calls winbindd_getpwsid()
as well so there is only one code path to debug.
