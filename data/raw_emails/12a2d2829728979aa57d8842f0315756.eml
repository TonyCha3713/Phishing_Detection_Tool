I beg to differ on that, since his question was regarding activesync
functionality, and had nothing to do with using the braillenote as a
braille display under gnu/linux. Yes, perhaps this list wasn't the

been an even worse place for it. Again, see the above URL for an
explanation of what activesync is.
