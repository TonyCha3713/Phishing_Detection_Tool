In answer to my own questions....

svn2bzr.py has gone missing from so I cannot make any
more progress on this one.  I remember some discussion
on the bzr ml so I'll try to fig it up from there.

> * What is the status of bzr repositories and cheap branching?

After reading http://bazaar-vcs.org/SharedRepositoryTutorial,
it appears that bzr repositories are designed as a space saver
when branches share portions of revision history.  But you still
have to checkout each branch at a time unlike git-clone
which pulls all branches (or at least their history) at one time.

The bzrtools "switch" command allows to swap between lightweight
checkouts (think a cvs or svn checkout) created by 'bzr branch'
But this is basically a shortcut for 'cd new_branch && bzr update"
the way I understand it.  No real new functionality.
