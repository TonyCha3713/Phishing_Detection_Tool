> Hi all. I have been observing this thread for quite some time, and one 
> question keeps jumping out at me, every time I see another message 
> regarding moving Speakup into userspace. Why is it
> that instead of discussing ways to get Speakup into mainline, we are 
> contemplating rewriting Speakup as a userspace/hybrid program, thereby 
> introducing entirely new bugs/problems? Imo the only
> thing we are doing by contemplating this possible rewrite, is shifting the 
> focus away from the underlying problem that afaik, has been with us since 
> the Linux-2.4 days. As has probably been
> outlined here various times in the past, having Speakup in the mainline 
> kernel tree has several advantages; first, breakage/building problems 
> would be pretty nonexistent, since
> the rest of the kernel community would at least have to acknowledge the 
> existence of Speakup in the tree. Also, Kirk's job of constantly rewriting 
> new code/fixing existing code as a result of
> some change in a later kernel version would probably become significantly 
> easier, since the console/etc code that Speakup relies on for its 
> underlying operation, would have to be written and
> or modified with Speakup in mind, not the other way around. What I am 
> trying to say by all this, is that the advantages to having Speakup in the 
> mainline kernel tree are numerous; however, the
> problem is and has been getting to that point.
>
> Afaik there is still progress attempting to be made on this front, such as 
> a Git repository being made for Speakup and the driver patches. However, 
> as I understand it, Speakup's code needs
> quite a bit of cleaning up befor it can be considered for inclusion into 
> mainline. Unfortunately, I am not nearly familiar enough with the kernel 
> code to be able to aid in this task; however,
> I believe that if we all work together to achieve this goal, that it in 
> fact can be done. With regard to Gentoo dropping Speakup as of later 
> releases, while it is a setback as far as getting
> Speakup into as many distros as possible goes, I don't see why it can't be 
> re-included in Gentoo at some later date, once build and possibly other 
> issues are resolved with Speakup patched into
> Linux-2.6.22.
>
> In summary, imo userspace Speakup is not the only answer, nor is it the 
> correct one. Speakup should remain in the kernel, so as to provide the 
> best screen reading experience possible. However,
> in order to achieve this end, we first need to get Speakup into mainline. 
> This may take quite a bit of time and hacking; however, in time, I think 
> it can be done. Feel free to add any comments
> as necessary, I am curious as to what everyone has to say on this.
