Dear valued member!
We are writing to inform you about the result of the recent research concerning the quality of the drugs sold on the Internet.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad  we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia  so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Take care of your health  use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Tabitha Logan
USDrugs B.V.
