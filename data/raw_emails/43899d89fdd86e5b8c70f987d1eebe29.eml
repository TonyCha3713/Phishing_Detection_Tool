Folks,

Here's a small patch that disables the libkrb5.so replay
cache when verifying a ticket from winbindd_pam.c.
I've found during multiple, fast, automated SSH logins (such
as from a cron script) that the replay cache in MIT's krb5
lib will occasionally fail the krb5_rd_req() as a replay attack.

There seems to be a small window during which the MIT krb5
libs could reproduce identical time stamps for ctime and cusec
in the authenticator since Unix systems only give back
milli-seconds rather than the micro-seconds needed by the
authenticator.  Checked against MIT 1.5.1.  Have not
researched how Heimdal does it.

My thinking is that if someone can spoof the KDC and TDS
services we are pretty hopeless anyways.

I have customers hitting this now so it's a real issue.
Maybe this should be configurable and always use the rcache
by default.  Comments ?



cheers, jerry
