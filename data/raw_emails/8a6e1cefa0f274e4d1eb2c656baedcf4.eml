 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

I believe that the MIDI files can be distributed under the GPL. I mean,
if you use a non-free IDE to write a program, would the GPL restrict you
from distributing your code under it? I doubt it.

As long as the MIDI files don't need the original (Shareware) program to
play you should be fine distributing it under the GPL.

But don't act just on me, wait until someone confirms this; I don't have
much experience in debian-legal, so I may be wrong.
