Hi all.

Say I want to get 2 files via ftp, but I want to do it in a specific
order, and I don't want file2 to start downloading until file1 is
finished downloading. For example, if I were to execute get file1.tar,
and get file2.tar, I want get file2.tar to be executed only after get
file1.tar is done.

I see that lftp has a queue command. Does anyone know if this would
work the way I expect? What I mean is if I execute:

queue get file1.tar
queue get file2.tar

in lftp, would that in fact wait to download file2.tar until the
download of file1.tar was complete?

If the queue command in lftp doesn't work this way, then is there
another command that would do what I want? If lftp can't do what I
want, then can ncftp do that? If so, then how? I have looked through
the ncftp man page as well, and this doesn't seem to be doable in
ncftp. If neither lftp or ncftp can do what I want, then is there
another ftp client for gnu/linux that can?

Just to clarify, I don't want to time-schedule the downloads, I simply
want them to happen sequentially one after another, in a specific
order, (I.E. file2.tar can download right after file1.tar, but it
can't start downloading while file1.tar is still being downloaded).

On another note, does anyone know for sure if put in lftp or ncftp
will retry an upload until it successfully completes, if the upload
keeps being interrupted, say due to network issues? I'm fairly sure the
answer here for both programs is yes, but I wanted to make
certain. Thanks in advance.

Greg
