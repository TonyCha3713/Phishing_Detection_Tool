Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is. Man consists of two parts, his mind and his body, only the body has more fun.
Life is a wilderness of twists and turns, where faith is your only compass. It is not from ourselves that we learn to be better than we are.

Hi Ronnie,

can you also add this to libcli/util/doserr.c so that
win_errstr() displays it...
