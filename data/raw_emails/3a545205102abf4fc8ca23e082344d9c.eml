My "dumb idea" sold over 12 million copies of a single book 
and allowed me to start a world-famous training business. 

Now, I want to "take you by the hand" and show you how to 
turn your "dumb idea" into a business reality... and possibly... into a windfall fortune!

See how it works

To make this clear, I don't propose to use the samba4 build system
