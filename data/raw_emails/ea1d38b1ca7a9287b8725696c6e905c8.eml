Everybody knows that a Cart1er w4tch is a silent statement of wealth and luxury. But we all know as well that
the price of putting one of them on your wrist is for the most unaffordable by the average Joe. Thats why
repl1ca Cart1er w4tches are becoming more and more popular by the day. Theyre actually the affordable
solution to this dilemma. And thanks to the internet, there is now a place where the highest quality Cart1er
repl1cas are available: Prest1ge Repl1cas. So, why not take a look at the extensive inventory that this site
has to offer? After all, browsing through their hundreds of Cart1er w4tches is absolutely free, and buying the
one of your dreams is simply inexpensive.

Yeah but that's not what I asked.  I know there are tools
for mDNS but does anyone admin'ing Samba servers care?
It's not so much a technical question as it is a popularity
vote.  If no one uses the feature, it will bit rot.  And
that would leave us in worse shape than having no mDNS
support at all.
