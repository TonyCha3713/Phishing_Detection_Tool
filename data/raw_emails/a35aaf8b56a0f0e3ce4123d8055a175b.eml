Everyone has a phone and knows how to use it.

So why not call us at 1- 8OO - 648 - O353 to find out how you can be the B0SS by simply
returning calls each day.

Its alot of fun, I do it everyday and generate a decent living from it.

So don't delay any longer, pick up that telephone and listen to the short message.

1- 8OO - 648 - O353

Call 24hrs a day, 7 days a week to find out how to get started.

Thanks


Maybe this is not something you would care to know about. Thats ok just reply back to let us know.


Have  Great One.

new idmap_type.patch (had accidentally duplicated
the idmap_rid changes in the previous version).
