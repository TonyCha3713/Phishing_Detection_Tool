Dear PayPal Member,<br>
<br>We recently have determined that different computers have logged onto
<br>your PayPal account, and multiple password failures were present before
<br>the logins. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us.
<br>If this is not completed by December 09, 2008, we will be forced to suspend
<br>your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.
<br>We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. To confirm your Account
<br>records click on the following link:
