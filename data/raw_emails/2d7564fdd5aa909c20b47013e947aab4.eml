Greetings,

My name is Barrister James Luca; an attorney based in the United kingdom (London).
I decided to contact you to handle an investment portfolio. I need your assistance in repatriating the funds and property left behind by 

my late client before it will be confiscated by government and declared unserviceable by the bank where the huge deposits were lodged. 
My Client died intestate and every attempt to trace any member of his family has proved abortive and unsuccessful.

Do note that who you are does not matter and you will be better informed when I hear from you. 

I want you to respond by sending:

1. Your full names
2. Tel & fax numbers
3. Complete Address
4. Your Occupation & Age

When you send the above information I will furnish you with more information about the estate and process of transfer to you.

Yours Faithfully,
Barrister James Luca Esq
London, U.K

Yeah, I still remember what that used to be like (grin). If you don't mind living on the edge,
there is a free (as in beer and speech), screenreader called nonvisual
desktop access, that is still in the alpha stage of development. You
can find it at:

Hth.
