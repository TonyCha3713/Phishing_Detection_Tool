Dmix is a software mixer for alsa. If you're using I believe alsa 0.10
or later with a card that isn't multi-channel, dmix is used
automatically, so you don't need to do anything to activate
it. Otherwise, you can activate dmix with a $HOME/.asoundrc
file. You'll need to search the web to find out exactly what should go
in that file to activate dmix, since I got rid of my $HOME/.asoundrc
when alsa started supporting dmix by default on cards which need
it. I'm by no means an expert on this, so anything I've said here
stands to be corrected.

The information I've found so far seems to center on a file named asoundrc--which I've never heard of before, and who's format is a mystery to me.
