I'm just back from vacation and need a bit more time to read all the
mails...

what is the rule with

if ( foo != 0 ) vs. if (foo != 0)
and
if ( ! foo ) vs. if (!foo)

I really like the 2nd varint much more and that's what all the code in
samba4 and the linux kernel uses. But in the last time I saw the 1st
variant was used in samba3 sometimes.
