   The  orangutans  are two species of great apes known for their intelligence
and their long arms and reddish brown hair. Native to Indonesia and Malaysia,
they are currently found only in rainforests on the islands of Borneo and
Sumatra, though fossils have been found in Java, Vietnam and China. They are the
only extant species in the genus Pongo and the subfamily Ponginae  which also
includes the extinct genera [[Gigantopithecus]] and [[Sivapithecus]] . Their
name derives from the Malay and Indonesian phrase orang hutan, meaning  person
of the forest . ref   ref  ref     ref 

Orangutans are the most arboreal of the great apes, spending nearly all of their
time in the trees. Every night they fashion nests to sleep in from branches and
foliage. They are more solitary than the other apes, with males and females
generally coming together only to mate. Mothers stay with their babies until the
offspring reach an age of six or seven years. There is significant sexual
dimorphism between females and males  females can grow to around 4 2  feet or
1.3 meters and weigh around 100 lbs, while fully mature males can reach 5 9  or
1.8 metres in height and weigh over 260 lbs. ref   ref  Fully mature males can
be distinguished by their prominent cheek phalanges and longer hair.

Etymology The word orangutan  also written orang utan, orang utan and
orangutang  is derived from the Malay and Indonesian words orang meaning
 person  and hutan meaning  forest , thus  man of the forest . Orang Hutan is
the common term in these two national languages, although local peoples may also
refer to them by local languages. Maias and mawas are also used in Malay, but it
is unclear if those words refer only to orangutans, or to all apes in general.

The word was first attested in English in 1691 in the form orang outang, and
variants with  ng instead of  n as in the Malay original are found in many
languages. This spelling  and pronunciation  has remained in use in English up
to the present, but has come to be regarded as incorrect by some. ref   ref 
However, dictionaries such as the American Heritage Dictionary regard forms with
 ng as acceptable variants.

The name of the genus, Pongo, comes from a 16th century account by Andrew
Battell, an English sailor held prisoner by the Portuguese in  Angola   probably
somewhere near the mouth of the Congo River , which describes two anthropoid
 monsters  named Pongo and Engeco. It is now believed that he was describing
gorillas, but in the late 18th century it was believed that all great apes were
orangutans  hence Lac  p  de s use of Pongo for the genus. ref
name Groves2002   ref 

Behaviour and language Like the other great apes, orangutans are remarkably
intelligent. Although tool use among chimpanzees was documented by Jane Goodall
in the 1960s, it wasn t until the mid 1990s that one population of orangutans
was found to use feeding tools regularly. A 2003 paper in the journal Science
described the evidence for distinct orangutan cultures. ref
name Merrill2003   ref 

The first orangutan language study program, directed by Dr. Francine Neago, was
listed by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1988. The Orangutan language project at the
Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., uses a computer system originally
developed at UCLA by Neago in conjunction with IBM. ref   ref  Zoo Atlanta has a
touch screen computer where their two Sumatran Orangutans play games. Scientists
hope that the data they collect from this will help re</STYLE>

Folks,

As a small means of community service, I've decided to provide
an unofficial patched version of 3.0.24 (tagged as 3.0.24-gc-1)
to address the CVE-2007-2444, CVE-2007-2446, and CVE-2007-2447
security advisories.


The bzr branch is hosted at
  http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/samba-3-0-24-gc.bzr/

The source tarball is available from
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/people/jerry/3.0.24/

The Fedora Core 6 RPMS have been uploaded to
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/Fedora/

This is it *not* an official release from samba.org and therefore
has been signed with my GPG private key (ID D83511F6).  The
security issues have been officially fixed in Samba 3.0.25
upgrade release.  However, if you don't want to make the jump
to 3.0.25 just yet, this 3.0.24 based snapshot might be just
for you.




cheers, jerry

ATTENTION
=========

The Samba 3.0.24-gc-X releases are not official samba.org releases.
They are cut from a privately maintained branch which can be found
at http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/samba-3-0-24-gc.bzr/
This is done as a service to community to include backported fixes
to the Samba 3.0.24 release in case people do not wish to upgrade.

The 3.0.24-gc-X tree is not an active development tree but rather
a stable release branch similar to the Linux kernel 2.6.xx.yy releases.
My hope is that this will be helpful to some people.

More information about Samba.org official production releases
may be found at http://www.samba.org/.
