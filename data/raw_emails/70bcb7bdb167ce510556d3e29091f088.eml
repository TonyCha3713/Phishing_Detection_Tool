Much bigger change.  See Gunther's original patch.

What is your technical objection to the upn->sid->name
conversion?  Not "being a fan" is too vague.

IMO the client side is the perfect place to do much of
this stuff and if "winbind use default domain" had been in
the client code to begin with, winbindd itself would have
had many fewer bugs wrt to name translation.

Also doing combination operations like this prevent the
winbindd API from inheriting esoteric calls.  Why add a
new call to the API when you can write a wrapper around
to existing calls.  Given that pam_winbind is not
performance critical, as long as we don't introduce
inappropriate delays, this should be fine.
