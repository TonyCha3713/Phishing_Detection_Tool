ed his wife into their car as ashes fell from the sky. =22We're not too worried but want to get=
 out of here and observe the law.=22

Authorities hoped residents would be able to return to their homes by evening.

The fire destroyed Dante's View, a trailside terraced garden on Mount Hollywood, said Cit=
y Councilman Tom LaBonge.

=22This is a very sad night for Los Angeles,=22 he said.

Elsewhere in the region, a 300-acre fire near California State University at San Bernardi=
no was 75 percent contained. There were no reports of damages or injuries.

In neighboring Orange County, a 140-acre fire in Featherly Regional Park and a 1,250-acre=
 fire on a training range at Camp Pendleton were at least three-quarters contained.

On the East Coast, authorities evacuated about 300 homes in northern Florida as two fires t=
otaling 130,000 acres =E2=80=94 about 203 square miles =E2=80=94 continued to rage on the=
 Georgia-Florida line. Florida officials warned that they might soon need help if the blaz=
es grow out of control.

A 107,000-acre blaze in Georgia's Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge was called the lar=
gest blaze in state history and was nearing part of the park that has served as a fire crew com=
mand post. Another fire 10 miles away covered 40,000 acres.

The smaller fire crossed into Florida on Tuesday and was threatening Taylor, a small town w=
ith one store and no cell phone coverage, said Baker County Sheriff Joey Dobson.

In the Midwest, a wildfire near the Canadian border in northeastern Minnesota had burned 1=
6,266 acres since it was spotted Saturday. It destroyed around 40 buildings, including mu=
ltimillion-dollar homes, and forced more than 100 people to evacuate.=20

Authorities said they believe it started at a campsite just outside the Boundary Waters Ca=
noe Area.=20

=22There are some houses up there where all there is left is the foundation,=22 said Leif Lu=
nde of the Cook County Sheriff's Department. No injuries were reported, but Lunde said abo=
ut 30 of the burned buildings were homes or cabins.=20
