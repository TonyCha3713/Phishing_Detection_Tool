I don't see a reason to use the libnss_winbind from
Samba 3 with winbindd in Samba 4.  The client and server
are two halves of the same coin.

A lot of this goes back to the discussion about using
IDL for the pipe protocol.  I've had to on several
occassions work to ensure that a 32bit libnss_winbindd
could communicate with a 64bit winbindd.  This is a
big pain.

There's usually a very good reason for the diffeences
in Samnba 3.  The pstring/fstring change is just to
support a list of group names rather than a single one.
Should be a marshalled string in reality but until we nove
to IDL, static sized structures are the rule of the day.





cheers, jerry
