Ladies always giggled at me and even guys did 
in the public toilets! Well now I laugh at them 
because I took Xtrasize+ for 6 months and now my dick 
is much bigger than "average" size.

I bought them from this store... http://fastherbals.com

You can have up to 4 ide devices in your system without needing an
additional i/o card. So yes, you could have 1 cd-rom drive, and 3 hard
drives, or any combination there of. You need to make sure that all
your devices are jumpered properly, and that the bios is set up to
recognize your drives correctly.

Seriously, if you find yourself running out of room a good part of the
time, consider getting a bigger drive, that's what I ended up having
to do. I do seem to recall though, that you have an older system
running win98. If that's the case, then your bios might not be able to
fully recognize the capacity on today's drives, depending on how old
your system is. This of course, might or might not be fixed by a newer
version of your bios, assuming the bios on your board is flashable,
and not an eprom.

BTW, I do recall this kind of stuff being discussed on here more then once,
so you might want to have a look through the list archives.
