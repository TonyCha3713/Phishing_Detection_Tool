If we have support for opportunistically subscribing to people who're in
your activities, this would work for people on other servers too. How they get
into your activities in the first place is harder - there'd have to be
some way to invite them (in a way it's a pity our JIDs are so
human-unreadable, but there's not really any better way to allocate
them, and having the key fingerprint in the JID is very useful for our
automatic contact coalescing). I agree that this should be something to
develop later, but I'll keep it in mind when I set up the API for
current work.

This isn't a problem for activities which use tubes (Connect, at
the moment; Write, relatively soon) and is less of a problem for activities
which use UDP and have NAT traversal support (Call, which can work through
reasonably permissive NATs).
