Maybe they produced to much noise when I tried them so that new warnings
from the other flags would not be noticed because of this noise.
I added them disabled to remind me to enable them when I have time to
also fix the warnings.

I'm currently looking at them again and will may enable them
and also add some others we don't have yet...
