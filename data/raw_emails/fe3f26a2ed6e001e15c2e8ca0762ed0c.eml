The  Burmese Python   Python molurus bivittatus  is a very large python native
to southern Asia, and common in the exotic pet trade. It is strictly
terrestrial, but heavy bodied. A Burmese Python at Serpent Safari Park in
Gurnee, Illinois, USA previously held  ref   ref  the record for heaviest living
snake, with a weight of 182.76 nbsp kg  403 nbsp lb  at a length of 8.23 nbsp m
 27 nbsp ft  as of 2005. ref   ref  Females are typically larger than males.

Geographic Range and Habitat

The Burmese python is found throughout southeast Asia including Myanmar
 formerly called Burma, their namesake , Thailand, Vietnam, China, and
Indonesia. Wild populations are considered to be  threatened  and are listed on
Appendix II of CITES. All the giant pythons  including the Indian Python, the
African Rock Python, and the Reticulated Python  have historically been
slaughtered to supply the world leather market, as well as for folk medicines,
and captured for the pet trade. In more recent years extensive captive breeding
of the Burmese Python has made the importation of wild caught specimens for the
pet trade uncommon.

Description Burmese Pythons are light colored snakes with many dark brown
blotches bordered in black down the back. Their perceived attractiveness of
their skin pattern contributes to their popularity with both reptile keepers and
the leather industry. The pattern is similar in color, but different in actual
pattern to the African Rock Python  Python sebae , sometimes resulting in
confusion of the two species outside of their natural habitats.



Behavior Burmese Pythons are diurnal rainforest dwellers. When younger they are
equally at home on the ground and in trees, but as they gain girth they tend to
restrict most of their movements to the ground. They are also excellent
swimmers. Like all diurnal snakes, Burmese Pythons spend the majority of their
time basking in the sun to moderate their body temperature, and to aid in
digestion of meals.

Burmese Pythons breed in the early spring, with females laying clutches which
average 12 36 eggs in March or April. She will remain with the eggs until they
hatch, wrapping around them and twitching her muscles in such a way as to raise
the ambient temperature around the eggs by several degrees. Once the hatchlings
use their egg tooth to cut their way out of their eggs, there is no further
maternal care.

Diet Like all snakes, Burmese Pythons are carnivorous. They will consume a wide
variety of prey items, their diet consisting primarily of appropriately sized
birds and mammals which they subdue via constriction. They are often found near
human habitations due to the presence of rats and other vermin as a food source.
However, their equal affinity for domesticated birds and mammals means that they
are often treated as a pest. In captivity their diet consists primarily of
commercially available, appropriately sized rats, and moving up to larger items
such as rabbits and poultry as they grow. Exceptionally large pythons may even
require larger food items, such as pigs or goats.


In captivity Burmese Pythons are often sold as pets, and are made popular by
their attracti</STYLE>
