Wenn zum Beispiel jemand schreibt, die "Luftrettungs-Service-Vermittlungs GmbH" sei eine "Betr&#252;gerfirma", eine "Hubschrauber-Mafia", die angeblich schon einmal jemand verklagt habe.

I would prefer a more complex, but realistic test environment that is
static, for most configurations.  That way, I know where things are, and
can easily aim tests (including ad-hoc tests/debugging in 'make
testenv') at whatever parts I need.

Perhaps I'm just too simple of mind for this job.

If the cost is a few environment variables, that's a reasonable cost.=20

I want to see it scale at least to the reasonable cases we currently

I'm quite happy for tests to declare what environments they need, but
for the moment, I would really like all those environments to be
provided. =20

I'm simple of mind, and I just don't like my test target moving in front
of me.
