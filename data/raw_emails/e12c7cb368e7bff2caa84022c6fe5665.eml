Hi. I asked around on #mutt on Freenode, and apparently a patch was merged in that changes some of the options around, 
and adds an inline option to the PGP menu. It seems this patch is already applied as of Mutt-1.5.15. More info on this 
patch at http://www.woolridge.ca/mutt/pgp-menu-traditional.html.
