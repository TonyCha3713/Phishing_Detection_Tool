The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself.

To upgrade to testing, all you really need to do is to replace the
stable word on every line of your /etc/apt/sources.list with the word
testing. Then, just do apt-get update, and apt-get dist-upgrade.

I can't really answer your kernel question, since I role my own.
