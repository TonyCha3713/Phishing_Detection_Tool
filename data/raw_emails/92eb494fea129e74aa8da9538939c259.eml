Greetings,

My name is Barrister James Luca; I am an attorney based in the United kin=

portfolio. I need your assistance in repatriating the funds and property =
left behind by my late client before it will be confiscated by government=
 and declared unserviceable by the bank where the huge deposits were lodg=
ed. 
My Client died intestate and every attempt to trace any member of his fam=
ily has proved abortive and unsuccessful.
Do note that who you are does not matter and you will be better informed =
when I hear from you. 

I want you to respond by sending:

1. Your full names
2. Tel & fax numbers
3. Complete Address
