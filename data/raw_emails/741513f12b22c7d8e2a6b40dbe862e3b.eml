THis is possible, using the uinput module from the kernel.

BrlTTY uses this, and does so quite efficiently. As it is, if a user 
wants to run speakup and BrlTTY, there could be a problem with both 
programs wanting to share the same devices.

THere has in fact been discussion on the BrlTTY mailing list about 
extending BrlTTY to have speech/screen reader via keyboard 
functionality. Patches would be accepted for BrlTTY to do this.
