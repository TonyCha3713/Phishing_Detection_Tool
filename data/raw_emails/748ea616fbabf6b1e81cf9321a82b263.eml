The blacklist of unreliable or simply fraud shops is updated every week. We strongly recommend to visit our site before buying any medical products online. visit us

The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself.

Wanye,

See the nss_info changes in 3.0.25.  You can write you own plugin to
serve this information how you like.  If you need further technical
details, please let me know.

I'll work on providing API docs for the IdMap and Nss_info
interfaces soon.





cheers, jerry
