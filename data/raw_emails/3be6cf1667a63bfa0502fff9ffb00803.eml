FROM ALFRED FIFAJI
THE HEAD OF FILE DEPARTMENT, AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
COTONOU, BENIN REPUBLIC, WEST AFRICA
TELEPHONE: 00229 97071419
STRICTLY PERSONAL
I am Alfred Fifaji, Head of Files/Records Department and Debt  
Recovering Unit in the African Development Bank, Cotonou, Benin  
Republic in West Africa.
Firstly, I must solicit your explicit confidence in this  
transaction.This is by virtue of  its nature as being utterly  
confidential and top secret. However, after series of petitions have  
been received by this regime from Foreign Contractors regarding the  
inability of the African Development Bank to settle all outstanding  
debts owed to Foreign Contractors, a committee (which I was the  
head)was set up to carefully review all overdue debts owed to foreign  
contractors and recommend for immediate release of such funds with  
immediate effect.
During the investigation period, we discovered an abandoned sum of 35   
Million (Thirty five million United States Dollars) belonging to a  
German business magnate and property consultant, Late Andreas  
Schranner. The late Mr Schranner died in a plane crash on Monday, 31st  
July, 2000 alongside his family members. The BBC website  
refers:http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
Since we got information over his sudden death the bank has made  
frantic efforts to locate his reltions, but all attempts failed. The  
bank cannot release this funds to anyone except it receives an  
application from anybody who would stand as the next of kin or  
business partner to the late customer.
It was based on this discovery that my collegues and I conceived the  
idea of contacting you, based on the good recommendation given to me  
by a friend who works with the chamber of commerce and industries  
here. We do not want the funds to be shared by the board of directors  
of the bank who may wake up one day to declare it "unclaimed funds".  
We need your unflinching support and cooperation to have the funds  
transferred to your nominated bank account. Please, note that upon the  
successful transfer of the funds to your bank account, you shall be  
entitled to 25% of the total funds as your share. I shall at a  
subsequent date come to your country to open an account where I will  
deposit our 75% of the funds.
Having done a thorough feasibility study on how to perfect the  
transfer of the funds to your bank account, your role shall be to send  
an application for claim of the funds to the bank as a next of kin or  
business partner to the late Andreas Schranner. I also would require  
your contact address, telephone and fax numbers for easy  
communication. Please, rest assured that the business is 100% risk free.
Upon receiving your response to this proposal, I would be most obliged  
to send to you a text of application for claim of the funds which you  
will send to the bank. Please, bear in mind that with your strong  
obedience to my guidance in this transaction, the funds would be  
transferred to your account within 14 working days.
I look forward to receiving your urgent response.
Best wishes,
Alfred Fifaji
