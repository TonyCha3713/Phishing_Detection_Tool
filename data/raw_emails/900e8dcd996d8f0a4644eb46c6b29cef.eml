The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

I expect we'll branch SAMBA_3_0_27 from SAMBA_3_0 since the
we already have most of the PIDL work merged to SAMBA_3_0_26.
There's a few things that exist solely in the 3_0 branch so
we'll have to discuss how everyone feels about those features
when it is time to branch.
