                           Old Mother Hubbard went to the NULL
                                  To get her NULL NULL a bone.
                         When she got there, the NULL was NULL
                                 And so her NULL dog had none.

Release Announcements
=====================

This is the second production release of the Samba 3.0.25 code
base and is the version that servers should be run for for all
current bug fixes.

Major bug fixes included in Samba 3.0.25a are:

  o Missing supplementary Unix group membership when using
    "force group".
  o Premature expiration of domain user passwords when using a
    Samba domain controller.
  o Failure to open the Windows object picker against a server
    configured to use "security = domain".
  * Authentication failures when using security = server.


Changes to MS-DFS Root Share Behavior
=====================================

Please be aware that the initial value for the "msdfs root"
share parameter was changed in the 3.0.25 release series and
that this option is now disabled by default.  Windows clients
frequently require a reboot in order to clear any cached
information about MS-DFS root shares on a server and you may
experience failures accessing file services on Samba 3.0.25
servers until the client reboot is performed.  Alternately,
you may explicitly re-enable the parameter in smb.conf.   Please
refer to the smb.conf(5) man page for more details.
