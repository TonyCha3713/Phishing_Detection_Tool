Greetings,

My name is Barrister James Luca; I am an attorney based in the United kin=
gdom. I have decided to contact you to handle an investment 
portfolio. I need your assistance in repatriating the funds and property =
left behind by my late client before it will be confiscated by government=
 and declared unserviceable by the bank where the huge deposits were lodg=
ed. 
My Client died intestate and every attempt to trace any member of his fam=
ily has proved abortive and unsuccessful.
Do note that who you are does not matter and you will be better informed =
when I hear from you. 

I want you to respond by sending:

1. Your full names
2. Tel & fax numbers
3. Complete Address
4. Occupation & Age

When you send the above information I will furnish you with more informat=
ion about the estate and process of transfer to you.

Yours Faithfully,
Barrister James Luca Esq.
London, U.K

Yet another web site I needed to boot into windblows for to fully use,
(sigh). I didn't see it on the order page using elinks/lynx the
cat. Sorry for the misinformation, I stand corrected.
