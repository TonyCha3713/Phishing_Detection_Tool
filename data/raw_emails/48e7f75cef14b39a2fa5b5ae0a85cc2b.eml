Hi Jeremy,

can you also update the documentation?
lib/talloc/talloc.3.xml and lib/talloc/talloc_guide.txt

Also some torture tests for lib/talloc/testsuite.c would be nice:-)

Maybe we should also define that the _strict() versions should be used
in samba3 and the normal versions in samba4 and backported code.
So that people doesn't need to guess what they should do,
as I think that's exactly what you want to prevent with this...
