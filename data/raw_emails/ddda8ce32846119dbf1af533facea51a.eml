I think in some ways that this encourages looser couplings
which is a good thing.  But if you are working closely
with another developer, you just pull changes from each
other's tree.  The patch is finally proposed for upstream
merge when it is "released" by the developers.  Meaning that
you or who ever your are working with have tested it
in the upstream tree and all checks out ok.

I'll point out that with more of the maintainer model, I
believe you'll see less upstream churn that will break
local work.  Upstream will change of course, but not
on the daily basis it has now.  And the DSCM model forces
for public discussion of changes to be merged as all
merge requests must go through the public mailing lists.

It's not automatic of course and requires coordination.
But the upstream trees become more stable due to the lack of
need for an experiemental upstream branch such as SAMBA_3_0.
In some ways, the upstream trees should always be stable.
Patches for a release will have to be backported where as
most of the time now, major portions of the SAMBA_3_0
and SAMBA_3_0_26 are identical and the multiple checkins
is just a "svn diff && (cd ,../other/tree && patch -p0)"

See comments above.  I really would like to see us move
away from the central repository and break the distinction
between those with svn commit access and those without.

Thanks.
