No, I have another account that sends anything that's already in Razor to the 
spamtrap, unless it's a Bugtraq message, in which case I revoke it as that 
account (not as the spamtrap). I'm talking about the situation before I 
checked for Bugtraq in the procmailrc. The message was sent to the spamtrap 
because it was in Razor, then I manually revoked it as the spamtrap because 
it was erroneously reported. The spamtrap is not, and never was, subscribed 
to Bugtraq.
