DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES
PLOT 225 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET VICTORIA ISLAND,LAGOS-NIGERIA.


ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/ C.E.O
RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear Sir,

I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any previous meeting or communication. I got your reference from your country`s trade department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council (NEPC). 

I am IBRAHIM TAOFIK Head of the above department of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,my term of reference involves the award of contracts to multinational companies.My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award, screening, categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected projects and supervising the project consultants involved. 

A breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter of 2005 indicates that DPR paid out a whooping sum of US$936M (Nine Hundred And Thirty Six Million United States Dollars) to successful local and foreign contract beneficiaries. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid for this final Quarter of the year 2006.

The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR deliberately over-invoiced the contract value of the various contracts awarded. In the course of disbursements, this department has been able to accumulate the sum of US$36.6M (Thirty-Six Million, Six hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) as theover-invoiced sum. 

This money is currently in a suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee (DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will be fronting for us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign account to transfer this fund into.

However, for your involvement in assisting us with this transfer into your nominated account we have evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 30% for you as the foreign partner
(2) 65% for I and my colleagues
(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both Locally and Internationallyduring the course of this transaction.

We shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of our share in any business in yourcountry. Be informed that this business is genuine and 100% safe considering the high-power government officials involved.

Send your private fax/telephone numbers . Upon your response we shall provide you with further information on the procedures.for further clarifications and discussions. All enquiries should be directed to me.

Looking forward to a good business relationship with you.

Sincerely,
IBRAHIM TAOFIK
