Nothing prevents test environments for guaranteeing both a dc and two
members will be up, for example.

If we have just one test network (with lots of hosts), then for example
"make test TESTS=TALLOC" will be very slow, whereas it is very fast at
the moment (doesn't need to do any provisioning). Same goes for tests
that only require a dc.

Also, the current code makes it very easy to add support for other
targets (Samba3, for example) that don't support all test environments
(yet).

Perhaps you would simply like to make sure that all test environments
are set up in 'make testenv' ?

Cheers,

Jelmer
