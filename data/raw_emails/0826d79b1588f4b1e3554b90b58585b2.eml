This is the bottom line.  If you can GIVE AWAY CD's for FREE to people (like 80-100 in one month) and then let ME talk to them FOR you - if you can GIVE AWAY free product samples -  then YOU can earn $5,000 in the next 30 - 45 days.

Think I'm kidding?  We earned PRECISELY $26,087.58 in our first 94 days doing JUST that - and we scanned our checks online for you to see them with your own eyes!  We've TWEAKED things a little because WE DON'T WANT you to talk to ANYONE.  WE WANT to talk to people FOR YOU.

if you are ....
VERY BUSY or,
Aren't GOOD AT TALKING TO PEOPLE or,
DON'T WANT to talk to people....

Then let US work FULL TIME for you.  We've helped others....
   Julie P. earned $750 in one week with us
   Jeff A. earned $6500 in 5 weeks with us

And we NOW have an EXACT business plan for you and can tell you EXACTLY what to expect with where you're starting.  No guesswork - we've done it.

And if you DO want to seriously evaluate this, we would be HAPPY to even fly you to Los Angeles at OUR expense to get a closer look!  NO KIDDING!
