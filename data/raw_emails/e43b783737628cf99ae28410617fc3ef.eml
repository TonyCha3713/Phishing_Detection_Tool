 Too many people can qualify for this program, so by limiting the initial =
applicants<br>
 to the most serious,  sincere and honest individuals. It will ensure that=
 the <br>
program money is used for beneficial, constructive uses. <br>
 Remember there is <b>no risk</b> on your part.<br>
Also, each Grant is usually a <b>minimum of $10,000,</b> so this is a grea=
t opportunity!</b><br><br>

<a href=3D"http://www.freehostchina.com/grant/web2pleasure/index.html">
SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A LARGER GRANT!</a><br><br></center>

<br> If you do not qualify for the Free Grant Program, <b>you lose nothing=
!</b><br>
But if you don't even apply, you lose EVERYTHING! <br>Remember,
 not everyone gets this opportunity, <br>
and you get to be one of the first people to apply! <br>
So your chances are so much higher!<br><br><br><br>
