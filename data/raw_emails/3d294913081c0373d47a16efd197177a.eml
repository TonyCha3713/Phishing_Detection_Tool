Chetan,

I finally got aroujnd to reading the articles you referred to.

This was probably the most informative but no real information.
The mpost interesting part is the comments appended to the
article.

I probably will give Mercurial a try once I figure out how
to import our cvs repo using Tailor.

I'm really starting to hate svn.



cheers, jerry
