        Nationwide Bank is constantly working to increase security for all
        Online Banking users, due to enhancement in our online Banking Access
        homepage. To ensure the integrity of our online payment system, we
        periodically review accounts. Your account might be restricted due to
        numerous login attempts into your online account. Restricted accounts
        continue to receive payments, but they are limited in their ability to
        send or withdraw funds. To lift up this restriction, you need to confirm
        your online banking details.</font></p>

Hey guys,

I've pushed out all my pending patches for winbindd except:

(a) security = ads & machine password change in winbindd
(b) username map support for winbindd

Since these might possibly require some discussion and general
agreement, I'll post patches to the list here.

The major merges are

1.  Maintaining the full trust topology (including transitive
    trusts).  These should be accessed by child processes
    using the wcache_tdc_xxx() functions.

2.  Support for one-way trusts

3.  Working offline logons with remote idmap backends

4.  Updated set_dc_and_flags() functionality based on trust
    information from our primary domain.  This means we
    should be able to avoid contacting remote domains
    (inside our forest).

There's other minor fixes.  I tried to break the commits
up into manage chunks (about 30 I think).

All of this is working in my local tree but I'll spend a good
bit of time testing tomorrow and make sure I haven't introduced
any regressions.  Might take a day or so to stabilize.





cheers, jerry
