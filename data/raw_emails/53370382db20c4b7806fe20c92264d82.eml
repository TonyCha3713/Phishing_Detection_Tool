 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Sort of.  Use "git clone -l -s " to create local repos that
share objects.

$ git clone git://git.samba.org/samba
$ cd samba
$ git checkout --track -b 4.0/work
$ git checkout --track -b 3.0/work
$ cd ..

$ git clone -l -s samba samba-3-0
$ git clone -l -s samba samba-4-0

$ (cd samba-3-0 && git checkout --track -b work origin/3.0/work)
$ (cd samba-4-0 && git checkout --track -b work origin/4.0/work)

The resulting work repos can be merged back into your main repo
later.

PS: Someone may have a better suggestion but this is what I do.
