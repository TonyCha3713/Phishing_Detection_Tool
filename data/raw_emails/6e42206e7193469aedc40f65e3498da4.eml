Jeremy,

It's is better IMO to use the correct context pointer
so that in this case you can free the array
witout worrying about it the mem_ctx point is freed
I think Michael's original code is correct.
For example, this is how the struct samu* stuff
is done.

The moral of the story is "Don't mix malloc and
talloc".
