You don't need an initrd if you don't want to use one, I
don't. However, if you go without an initrd, make sure that things
like your ide/sata chipset, and hd support and the root file system
you use are built into the kernel itself, else you won't be able to
boot. Then, install kernel-package, untar the kernel sources, run make
oldconfig/config/menuconfig, and then run

make-kpkg kernel_image.

If you were building in /usr/src/linux for example, then the resulting
deb will be in /usr/src. Then, install it with dpkg -i package.deb,
where package.deb is the file kernel-package created. Then you'll need
to add the new image to your boot loader, this may or may not be done
for you when you install the package. I'd strongly suggest keeping
your current kernel in the boot loader as well, so that you can boot
back with it if your new kernel panics and doesn't boot. Then reboot.

If the new kernel works like you'd expect, then you can remove your
old kernel from your system, and from the boot loader of course as
well.

This is a very brief description, there are howtos and docs on the web
that cover this in much more detail.
