Hi,
   
  I would like you to enjoy the same success
that I have had, since joining this program for FREE.
Cost you nothing to join!

  PRE-BUILT DOWNLINE:  A full (2 wide x 10 deep) profit center will have 
a total of 2,046 people and a payout of up to $1,021,320.00 per year.

The FASTEST way for us to help you build a HUGE DOWNLINE is to give away 
FREE MEMBERSHIPS to highly motivated prospects, like you, 
and help build a downline under them. 

 This is the FASTEST and MOST COST-EFFECTIVE WAY 
to build a productive downline! 

    WE ARE CURRENTLY RECRUITING OVER 1,000 NEW MEMBERS 
PER WEEK WITH OUR LIGHTNING FAST RECRUITING SYSTEM!!!

Go to:

Code Number  000-01-3118


PS... After I received my info pack, the company already 
had placed 30 people under me

this attribute is constructed and we should generate it instead of store
