Actually, I believe we specifically want to authorize "diminishing the
distinctiveness" or "harming the reputation".  Trademark dilution and
trademark libel suits are not appropriate for free software, if they are
ever appropriate.

Use of a trademark to harm the reputation of the trademark holder is an
essential right for those who wish to attack the trademark holder for
what they see as bad behavior.

"Dilution" is far far too vague and abusable for it to be appropriate to
prohibit it.   Most cases of trademark abuse by big corporations seem
to, as far as I can tell, rely on "dilution" and "tarnishment" theories,
not on infringment.

We just want to disallow actual infringement, not these other things.

So I would only go with

"Your use of the trademark may not create a sense of endorsement,
sponsorship, or false association with the trademark holder."

Period.  Actually, for clarity, we want to point out that you can create
a sense of endorsement or sponsorship if you are in fact endorsed or
sponsored, so I'd prefer something like:

"Your use of the trademark may not create a false sense of endorsement,
sponsorship, or association with the trademark holder."

Thoughts?
