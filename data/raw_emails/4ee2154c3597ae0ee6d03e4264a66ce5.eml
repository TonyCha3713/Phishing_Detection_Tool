Hey folks.
I am currently using ttsynth with the speakup connector utility, and so 
far, I am quite impressed. The synth is incredibly responsive, even on a 
dual celeron 466Mhz box. One thing I have noticed however, is that 
speech does not shut up very quickly when one presses a key, or the 
control key. Speech also overlaps when quickly skimming over text, 
either by line, word, or character. I'd say this has something to do 
with ALSA being used, but is probably not too hard to work around in the 
code. The utility also randomly crashes sometimes, and I hope to see if 
I can debug that.

Janina, what is the speakup connector source code license?

I can make Ubuntu/Debian packages if people are interested.
