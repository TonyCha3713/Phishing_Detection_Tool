I agree.  There are no samba build dependencies which is
the normal reason to maintain things in our trees.
Whoever maintains it should move it to its own repo
and make it a separate project IMO.  But if no one does,
we can just keep it in the lorikeet repo so that it
doesn't get lost.

We can host it on samba.org of course if needed.
