Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

The debian/Ubuntu packaging is IMO, rather woeful. It would have been 
much better to ask the license questions in the preinst script using 
debconf. As an Ubuntu packager, I do not endorce the packaging quality 
of the deb.

I would also think that offering a tarball download would make sense, as 
there are users of other distros here, such as Slackware. At this point, 
such users have to jump through hoops just to get the package 
installed.
