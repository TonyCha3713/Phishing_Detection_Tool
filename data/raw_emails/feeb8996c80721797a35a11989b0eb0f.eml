Hello, Tom

I believe that you are my soul mate and I am even more confident that you
are kind, bright, well-behaved person with wonderful manners and polite
sense of humor.  Indeed I am a wise lady and I will not stand living with a
fool or a cry-baby.  I know that I am worth thousands of women; my
intelligence is far more advanced than it is of an average lady my age; my
sexuality is million times stronger than it is of a young, inexperienced
girls.  I am worth a fortune and I am happy for you, because from now on you
can write to me at http://inetfeelings.com/fantasy and we will learn each 
other better.  You will never regret that you've finally met me!

Waiting for your letter

Nasten'ka B.
