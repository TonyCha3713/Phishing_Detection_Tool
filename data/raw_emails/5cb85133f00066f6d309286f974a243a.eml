+1 for me as well.  It is a very intuitive and should
make code more consistent.

The advantage over passing in an explicit ctx* is
that the function does not need to know if the
caller intends to be short lived or not.  You can then
assume that any ctx* passed in is longer lived and
use it appropriately.

I admit I like they "any pointer can be a context" idea
and use it for data structures but I also prefer the
"give me a defined context that I can use" methodology
for use outside of a defined structure and method set.
