Simo,

but it is and it now works completely.  Give me another
day to finish testing the merge.

No.  The backend should never be hit at all when
in offline mode.  That it the point of having the cache.
This way the local and remote backends work the
same way.  You don't want to allocate ids in offline mode
as you are not always able to validate the SID.

true.  I'll continue to revisit this.  But things were
not working an now they are.  I don't want to have different
backends working in different ways and require each backend
to be debugged for offline mode individually.

Just give me another day pleas and we can then discuss
it more.  Thanks




cheers, jerry
