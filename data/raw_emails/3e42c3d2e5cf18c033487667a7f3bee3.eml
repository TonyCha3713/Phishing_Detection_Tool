arrested Former Liberian President, Charles Ghankon Taylor who was 
arrested on Thursday 30th March 2006 after our planed escaped from
Custody where we had been for the past three Years failed.
I narrowly escape from being arrested at Gamboru Boarder town on our way 
to Cameroun, but my boss was arrested and immediately flown to Sierra 
leone were he is now facing a trial for alleged war crimes.

WHY CONTACTING YOU

At the Moment, I am still in a town in Cameroun with  documents related to
a certain deposit equivalent
of ( Seventy Five Million Dollars )that was deposited with a Financial
Institution Abroad since 4 years
ago.
I need your assistances (to Execute this  transaction since time to attain
my own financial majesty for this

money on my behalf from the Finance House/company for investment in  your
country.

If you know you are not going to betray the trust I am about to repose in 
you, please send to me without delay, your name and address, phone and 
fax, so that I will send to you the details of how to go about  claiming
the deposit for save keeping pending when I will come over to your country
for my share and Investment. For your anticipated
Assistance, you will be offered 30% of the total sum.

NO risk involve, because I am not a wanted person, and with look of 
things, there is no way my boss could free himself from a ten count 
charges pressed against him now.  So that gave me the much-needed time  to
transfer the (Deposit) funds out from the Finance House/company.
All that is needed of you is your unflinching support and transparent 
honesty.
