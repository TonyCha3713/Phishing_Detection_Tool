Dear valued member!
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
This letter is NOT a piece of ad  we just want you to know that more 80% of the drugs you purchase on the Internet come from underground factories in southern Asia  so, apparently, no one can say that they are totally safe. The only drugstore that has managed to prove the quality of its meds so far is USDrugs.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Merle Swain
USDrugs B.V.
