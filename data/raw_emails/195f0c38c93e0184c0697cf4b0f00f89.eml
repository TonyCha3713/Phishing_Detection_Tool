<center> <div id=3D=22banner=22> <=21--Sunni militants are believed to have withdrawn=
 to surrounding areas such as Diyala province where they have safe haven. The U.S. command a=
lso deployed an extra 700 soldiers to the area last month.

A U.S. soldier also was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in Muqdadiyah, about 60 miles no=
rth of Baghdad, a predominantly Shiite area that also is in Diyala, the military said in an e=
arlier statement. A British soldier was shot to death while on patrol in the southern city o=
f Basra, officials said.

The deaths raised to 85 the number of U.S. service members who died have in        Iraq in April, mak=
ing it the deadliest month for American troops since December, when 112 died.

It was the single deadliest attack on ground forces since Dec. 1, 2005, when a roadside bomb=
 killed 10 Marines and wounded 11 on a foot patrol near Fallujah.

Twelve soldiers died when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Diyala on Jan. 20. The militar=
y said it might have been shot down but the investigation is still ongoing.

In other devastating attacks, 14 Marines were killed when a roadside bomb struck an amphib=
ious assault vehicle near the western town of Haditha on Aug. 3, 2005. And a suicide bomber s=
truck a mess tent in a base near Mosul on Dec. 21, 2004, killing 22 people, including 14 U.S. s=
oldiers and three American contractors.

At least 68 Iraqis were killed or found dead Monday, according to police, including 10 in a s=
uicide car bombing against a police station in the Diyala provincial capital of Baqouba.

With the U.S. casualty toll mounting, Democratic leaders in Washington agreed Monday on l=
egislation that requires the first American combat troops to be withdrawn from Iraq by Oct=
=2E 1 with a goal of a complete pullout six months later. Bush has promised to veto any such meas=
ure as the legislative confrontation intensifies.

U.S. officials, meanwhile, signaled that they might reconsider putting a three-mile con=
crete barrier around a Sunni Arab neighborhood in Baghdad after Iraq's struggling prime m=
inister came under pressure from Sunnis and ordered construction of the wall halted.

He said he did not want the 12-foot high wall in Azamiyah to be seen as dividing Iraqis based o=
n their religious affiliation, throwing the strategy of sealing off Baghdad neighborhoo=
ds from sectarian attacks into doubt.

We really need a release manager/maintainer for this.  Cutting
RPMS out of an svn tree is probably not the best way to track
stability :-)

Andrew, you had looked into this in the past.  Is anyone
interested in taking it over?
