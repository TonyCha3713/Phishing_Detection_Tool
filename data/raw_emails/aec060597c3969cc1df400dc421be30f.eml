We always support DES-CBC-MD5, DES-CBC-CRC and RC5-HMAC if
the library supports them. We no longer use the default settings for
enc types from krb5.conf.  So I'm wondernig if the build linked
against the wrong libs.    Can you send me a level 10 debug log
and a raw packet trace illustrating the problem?
