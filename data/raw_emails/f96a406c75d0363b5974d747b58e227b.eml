Dear valued <b>PayPal=AE</b> Customer,
<br><br>
Due to recent fraudulent transactions, we have issued the following securi=
ty requirements.
<br>
<br>
It has come to our attention that 98% of all fraudulent transactions are c=
aused by members
using stolen credit cards to purchase or sell non existant items. Thus we =
require our members to add a Debit/Check card
to their billing records as part of our continuing commitment to protect y=
our account and to reduce the instance of 
fraud on our website. Your Debit/Check card will only be used to identify =
you. If you could please take 5-10 minutes 
out of your online experience and renew your records you will not run into=
 any future problems with the <b>PayPal=AE</b> 
service. However, failure to confirm your records will result in your acco=
unt suspension.
<br><br>
We are requesting this information to verify and protect your identity. Fe=
deral regulations require all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify, and record identification from all persons=
 opening new accounts or obtaining ongoing 
payment services. This is in order to prevent the use of the U.S. banking =
system in terrorist and other illegal 
activity. For these reasons, <b>PayPal=AE</b> will utilize services provid=
ed by various credit reporting agencies to 
verify the information you submit to us.
<br>
<br>
Once you have updated your account records your pending <b>PayPal=AE</b> a=
ccount transactions will not be interrupted and 
will continue as normal.
<br><br>
<b>To update your billing records please proceed to our secure webform by =

<b>
