That is my only point.  The blog was linked from Linux Today
so due to the amount of press it will or has gotten, we need
to respond.  I agree that any needed fixes are probably not
a big deal and that the blog was not to most technical review
I've ever seen. But since no us has are really testing the
3.0.x joins against Longhorn, now is a good time to start.

No huge rush.  But by 3.0.26 we should at least know
what the playing field looks like.





cheers, jerry
