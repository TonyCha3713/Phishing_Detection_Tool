Dear valued member.
More and more people are getting concerned with the problem of fake drugs sold on the Web. This letter is aimed at helping you choose a really reliable Internet drugstore.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from  try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Hope that you take our advice seriously. Take care.

yes, the problem is that ldb_tdb returns just 0 search results, but
success when the basedn isn't present. And it realy should return
LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT in this case, but we have too many code not
checking for LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT, so that we would break a lot
if we would let ldb_tdb return LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_OBJECT.
