I understand the concerns that both of you as well as others have. I
spent 2 hours this morning arguing on both sides of this argument with
the amd64 lead for gentoo as well as other people. Here's the bottom
line.

The kernel folks have said that "speakup's code sucks" the gentoo kernel
folks have said the same thing in the bug.  The bottom line for them is
the code sucks there's less and less reason to support speakup, and now
it's breaking on more and more arches. You 2 at least seem to think that
if you sit back and wait, sooner or later it's going to get fixed. The
reality is that from what i can tell speakup has 1 main coder, kirk. I'm
sure that kirk has other things besides speakup he's working on, While
there may be a fix, it's not going to be a quick fix and the reality is
that the only fix that has been found for this problem is to bring part
of it out into user space, see comment 8 i think it is on the bug. So
the reality is it's being slowly dragged into user space anyway, you
might as well do it right and make it decent code in the process so that
distros can start supporting it again.
