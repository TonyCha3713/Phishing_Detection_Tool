Hi all. I downloaded the checkout script from linux-speakup.org/pub/linux/speakup, so that I can attempt patching 
Speakup into Linux-2.6.21.5. However, when I run checkout I get the following:
Patching version v26
CVSROOT not set.  Enter it below.  Hit enter for anonymous.
CVSROOT>
Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@linux-speakup.org:2401/usr/src/CVS
cvs login: authorization failed: server linux-speakup.org rejected access to /usr/src/CVS for user anonymous

Has the CVS username changed, and I'm just not aware of it? Thanks.
