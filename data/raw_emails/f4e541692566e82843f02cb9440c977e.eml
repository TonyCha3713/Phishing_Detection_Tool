Yes, it is always good to define the interface before doing the coding!
I typically do something like this but with structure hierachies in
within a header file or start like you've done but within a C file
returning NT_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED in the function bodies.
And when a sample caller of the API has all it needs I start
filling the function bodies.

The main thing I would like a tool for is syncing the header file with
the source file (it can be a manual called script), because syncing
prototypes and comments by hand is real pain and only lead to bugs...
