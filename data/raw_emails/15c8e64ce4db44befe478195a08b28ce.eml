Dear valued member.
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Take care of your health  use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!
