Mind describing how you're running qemu under windows? I just tried it
last week, and my attempts were a total failure.

I created an image called c.img with the qemu-img command, or whatever
it is. I stuck a floppy into the a drive. Then, in the folder where I
had c.img, from within cmd, the xp command prompt, I did:

qemu -L c:\progra~1\qemu\pcbios -serial com2 -fda a: -boot a c.img

I also did

qemu -L c:\progra~1\qemu\pcbios -serial com2 -fda a: -boot a -hda c.img

and neither of those worked. No floppy spin, no hd activity,
nothing. I was just still in the cmd window, and the only things on
the screen were the command-line I typed, which seemed to be repeated
for the second time when I read the screen with wineyes, but the
second time had pauses between the words in the reading (I.E. qemu
... -fda ... a: ...) and so on.

When I tried just:

qemu -L c:\progra~1\qemu\pcbios c.img

It worked, but qemu told me that c.img was not bootable. That's fine,
but how am I supposed to install an os in the first place? Any other
options besides that, even just adding -fda a: to the command-line
made it not work. Before you ask, yes, I did make an image of the
floppy under gnu/linux, and tried using the file, instead of the a:
drive, and yes, I did try leaving out the serial port, as well as the
- -boot a option. No luck. The only thing that worked is just to specify
the path to the bios files, and c.img at the end, which I can't
obviously boot from. If I left out the bios path and the -L flag, and
just did qemu c.img, qemu complained that it couldn't find the bios,
no surprise there.

This is the open source and free software Qemu.  It is quite fast, and is able to emulate several types of CPU as well as different types of sound card, network card, etc.  Running under Windows I can create .bat files, and run different systems from each.  I'm currently trying to get LFS working--I know, it's a lot of waiting and compiling, but I've got time.  If anybody's interested, the Qemu home page is:
