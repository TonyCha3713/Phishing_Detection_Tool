btw...I remember how we worked around this in 3.0.23.
We added the S-1-22-2-XX SIDs for all gis to the user's token
(thinking pf a Samba PDC here with a mapped ntadmins -> "Domain Admins"
group).  valid users = +ntadmins would still work because
we added S-1-22-2-XX and S-1-5-21-xxx-512 to the user's token
based on membership in the htadmins group.
