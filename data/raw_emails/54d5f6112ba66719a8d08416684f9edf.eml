This is in fact correct. You need to get the ttsynth say and speakup 
connector source code from he ttsynth.com website. When I last looked, 
these could be downloaded from the main page.

No, sounds like the download was in fact complete. if the download was 
incomplete, the rpm command would have likely failed.

Also note that you will need the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 shared library 
present on your system to make use of ttsynth.
