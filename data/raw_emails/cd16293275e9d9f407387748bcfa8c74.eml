Dear valued member!
I wanted to advise you on which Web pharmacy to choose to save your time and money without having to risk your health.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Willie Hargrove
USDrugs B.V.

If you're asking if it is possible to find out which package a binary in /bin,
/sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin belongs to, then the answer is yes. You
need to install apt-file, then read up on how to use it.
