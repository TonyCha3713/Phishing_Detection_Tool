yeah, I've seen this happen also. This usually is caused as samba tries
to add the same SPN twice (where the 2nd is caused by a fauled
name_to_fqdn call).


Can you run your join with debug level 10 set and see if that is the
case ? pdfserver and pdfserver.infotecsys.de probably need to resolve to
an ip-address.
