All,

because of this bug [1], gentoo linux will be dropping support for speakup
in its official kernels starting at 2.6.22.

[1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=177794

Is there any possibility at all that speakup could be moved into user space
as the bug suggests?  I feel that if we can go into user space this will b a
better approach.

Thanks,

- --
