Here writes Lady Rita Mosley, suffering from cancerous ailment. I used 
to be married to Sir David Mosley English man(Deceased).My husband was 
into private practice all his life before his death.My husband and I 
made a vow to uplift the down-trodden and the less-privileged  
individuals as he had passion for people who can not help  themselves due to 
physical disability or financial predicament.I can adduce this to the fact 
that he needed a Child from this relationship,which never came.  

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 20 Million Great 
Britain Pounds Sterling which were derived from his vast estates and 
investment in capital market with his bank here in UK.Presently,
this money is still with the Bank.Recently,my Doctor told me that I have 
limited days to live due to the cancerous problems I am suffering from.
Though what bothers me most is the stroke that I have in addition to the cancer.
With this hard reality that has befallen my family and me,I have decided
 to donate this fund to you because I do not have any child that will inherit this  money. 

please,all i want from you is to help me use this gift which comes from 
my late husband effort to establish a charity home  called "Mosley 
Charity Foundation" for widows,and persons who prove to be genuinely 
handicapped financially.Due to my ill health, i cannot go further than 
this.Thus,I want you to assure me that you will act just as I have stated 
herein.Hope to hear from you.You can contact me through my private email 
address: ladyritamosley_uk@yahoo.co.uk

Lady Rita Mosley.

ok.  So let me ask this.  I understand that you wanted to be able to
to be able to look up both the unix and ntgroup names in the group
mapping tables.  But I'm pretty sure that we decided not to do
this in the 3.0.23 changes and just require the mapped named
in things like "valid users".

So my question is, "Do you still think your change is necessary?"
it only exists in the SAMBA_3_0 tree btw.




cheers, jerry
