 A quality form of ephedra is essential? 
 Our formula is concentrated many times and wrapped in a preservative-free capsule. This is the reason our formula is superior to others available.  Ours is grown by the top award winning growers in China. We ensure it is of the finest in the world. This is what separates our ephedra from other products. The proof is in the way it feels.  
 Please note that our formula contains only an organic form of ephedra?.It contains no chemical caffeine, chemical ephedrine, or taurine and thus avoids any of the negative side effects often associated with these other stimulants. 
 
 It is legal right now so act fast?
 On April 14, a federal Judge in Utah reversed the short-lived ban on ephedra for products of 10mg per serving.

 "I wake up at 6am to make breakfast and help my husband get out the door for work.

I wake up at 6am the next morning and do an almost identical day. I don't know what I would do without ephedra."  ? Noel Dawson, Super Mom, Ramona, California
