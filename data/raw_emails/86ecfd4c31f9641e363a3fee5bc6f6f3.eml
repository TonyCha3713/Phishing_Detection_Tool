Actually I grabbed everything and then created local branches
that I push out. In my .git/config, I just added:

[remote "samba"]
        url = jerry@git.samba.org:/data/git/samba.git
        push = v3-0
        push = v3-0-23
        push = v3-0-24
        push = v3-0-25
        push = v3-0-26
        push = v4-0

where each local branch was created from remotes/SAMBA_X_X

ok. Obviously this is a bit different than people without
svn write access would work.  Normally the git-svn repo is
strictly a mirror and used to push changes to the master
repo on git.samba.org.

Initially I clone git://git.samba.org/samba/ like everyone else
and work exclusively from there. When something is ready to
be merged upstream, I simply

  $ git-pull --squash /path/to/local/tree <branch>
  $ git-svn dcommit

To merge to another branch (say merge a change to SAMBA_3_0_26
that I just checked into SAMBA_3_0), I use git-cherry-pick to
merge the single change.

And to send out patches to the mailing list, I do something like:

  $ git-format-patch --attach -1
  ....edit generated file
  ....add comments to msg body and extra To: and CC: lines
  $ git-send-email <generated patchfile>

PS: If you want the svn+ssh:// git mirror, you can grab it
from rsync://us2.samba.org/src/samba-svn.git.tgz (~170Mb)
Once you untar it, just run "git-svn fetch"  You also see
the local working branches for v3-0, et. al. which you can
remove and create you own.  The sha1 hashes should continue
to be the same between the master mirror and your local copy
due git generates the content hashes.

PSS: That tarball will be of no use to people without svn
write access.




cheers, jerry
