Folks,

I've merged the IDL and pidl generated stubs from SAMBA_3_0
to SAMBA_3_0_26.  I've adopted Volker's proxy_xxx_call()
mechanism to allow us to replace the hand marshalled server
calls one by one.  See rpc_server/srv_lsa.c for examples.

Some on the conversion will be simple, boring grunt work.
Others will be a little more tricky. On Volker's suggestion,
I would like to propose is that we replace the server and
clients calls in Samba 3.0.26 one by one and removing the
related marshalling code fro rpc_parse/ as we go.  The idea
to to destabilize the tree as little as possible so thorough
testing of each RPC swapover is a requirement.  The cutoff
for RPC changes will probably be the 3.0.26pre1 release.

Sounds acceptable to everyone?





cheers, jerry
