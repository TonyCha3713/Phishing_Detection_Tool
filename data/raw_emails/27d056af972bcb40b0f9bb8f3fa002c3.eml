Ok, time for me to pipe in.  :)

Honestly, I find it odd that the spam fighting groups aren't working
and playing well, when the common enemy is the spammers, not each
other.  MAPS and ORBS had a battle for a while, and now DCC seems to
have issues with Razor.  Honestly, work on your own stuff, and let's
fix the spam problem, not pull out rulers.

In a spam filter, I'm much, much more concerned about false positives
than false negatives.  Additionally, since spam types are so varied, I
use all available and trustworthy (to me) methods to detect it.  I
tend to want something that has three levels (although nothing like
this exists, yet):

        red     is most certainly spam, verified by high ratings from
                several sources, and noone says "I know this is NOT
                spam."  I'd probably drop this into a bit-bucket, or
                archive it for humor value.  I expect no
                false-positives to be here.

        yellow  This may be spam.  A human should decide (and report).

        green   This is probably not spam.

spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has the is/isn't
switch, not is/maybe/isn't.  That said, razor is but one check in my
spam fighting arsenal, so if it reports "doesn't match known spam"
once in a while for well-known spam, something else will probably get
it.
