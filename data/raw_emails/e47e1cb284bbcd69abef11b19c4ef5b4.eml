Imagine being    part  of     a    stable      organization    with a    sterling      reputation   -   a  place       where     the Sydney   Car  Centre is    an      integral  part  of       all that       we     do.  With       our   car    centre personality,     you'll      not       just       succeed -       you'll thrive.      And,       with our       strong  commitment      to    promoting     from within,      you'll      definitely   enjoy      your     rise       to   the     top.<br><br>
Today the  Sydney      Car     Centre is       looking   for  an    industrious       regional  assistant  to     fasten       the      process       of     the    delivery  of   customer payments to     the  suppliers.    The position    offered    is    a    part-time     job,    and   will  only  require   from  you    to   be      available   for 1-2  hours   a    day.<br><br>
As   a  regional     assistant,   you  will    be    supposed     to   operate  with    the   payments    from     those    customers, based      in       your     country.  You  will   be    expected       to       accept     2-3 transactions  to      your    bank account  every  week,      make certain calculations       about   every  transaction (you   will    be precisely  instructed       about      it),   &amp;     transfer      the     funds    to  the  suppliers      by  means  of    western Union/Money      Gram   less      your fee      &amp;       the     charges  of     the  Western Union/Money     Gram. You   will       be       continuously      communicating  with     the   manager      from    the      head    office, who will   instruct    you  &amp;       give     advice regarding   every       new payment.<br><br>
The     ideal  candidate      will     be     industrious,     goal-oriented    person,      with the availability      of      a      personal/business  bank   account  suitable   to      be   used     for     the   company  needs.    Knowledge       of  English,     computer     literacy       and    sociability      are      appreciated.<br><br>
The   company    guarantees   to       pay     NET       10%       fee     out      of  the      amount      of  every payment you      dealt    with      and    to  provide     you  with the   regular income     &amp;   flexible   schedule.    All  the    related  expenses       you       might   have (like      the     Western     Union/Money Gram    chargers,  related   expenses       on      traveling) are       covered   by   the   company.<br><br>

vCard supports both FN (Formatted Name = display name, e.g. "Dan
Williams" and N (structured Name fields, e.g. "Williams;Dan;;Mr.;"). The
fields of N include family and given name, rather than first and last
name; there appears to be no way to indicate which comes first in the
locale of the subject of the vCard.

Telepathy's full Contact Info interface is under revision - the one
currently in the spec is far from ideal, but the replacement needs
further discussion - so I'd suggest we add "full-name" to the OLPC buddy
properties interface. We could always replicate one to the other
automatically, at some point.

For Salut, I think we should also add "jid" to the OLPC buddy properties
(it ought to be in contact info, but again, we don't have a good
interface for that), to make it easier to link mesh and server
identities. In my proposed implementation (which I'm still writing!) we
need to use the JID to link identities, because retrieving the public
key takes network round-trips, and it's problematic to have people turn
up and start interacting in a tube before we actually know who they are.

I'll add full-name support as part of my current round of API changes,
if there are no objections.

Are we happy for the child's full name to be public (to anyone who knows
their JID), from a privacy point of view? I realise the answer is
probably "yes", but I feel I should ask...

What's the intended UI for this? I assume we should use the name entered on
first boot to populate both the full name and the nickname, then let the child
change their nickname to something else later?

Once again, if there's any design documentation I should be consulting
on this, please let me know. Otherwise I'll just carry on trying to make
reasonable decisions so we can get something implemented.
