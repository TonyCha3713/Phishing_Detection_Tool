Alan,

The main thing that won me over to git was the git-svn
plugin.  I tried using Jelmer's bzr-svn plugin but never
got things going just right.  But git-svn just worked
out for the box. The reason why this is important to me
is that it allows for experimenting with git without
changing any samba.org infrastructure.  The git-svnimport
went smooth as well so these two are known quantities to me.

I assume that mercurial has something similar but a
quick search doesn't turn anything up.  Have you got
any pointers for me?





cheers, jerry
