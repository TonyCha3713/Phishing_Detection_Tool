Hi. What do you maen by 'insists thet the cable is not connected'? Do you get a message stating as such? Do you not get any responses back from your router's, or ISPs DHCP server? Can you not 
ping your router, even after you get an IP from it? I apologize I can't be of more help; however, if you provide more specifics of what exactly is going on/symptoms you experience, perhaps 
myself or someone on the list here can help. Hope the above questions point you in the right direction at least.
