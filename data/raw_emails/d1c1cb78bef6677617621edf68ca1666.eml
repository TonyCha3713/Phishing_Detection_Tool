Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.









Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 


for a sexually active male to obtain 


and sustain an erection for sexual
 purposes. In the past, this has been 



very embarrassing for men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 
and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment

 options available 


until very recently.
