We only have three different ones at the moment (none, dc, member) so it
should be easy to guess against which environment a test is being run.
Once we get more, it may be harder to keep track, but then provisioning
will be too expensive to set up all environments always anyway.

We can print out the environment name if that helps.

We do support doing that, though it is not the default. It can be very
useful in tracking down, for example, whether a test is corrupting one
of smbd's databases and thus is causing strange failures in subsequent
tests.

At the moment, though, we set up environments on a when-needed basis and
close them all when selftest exits.

Cheers,

Jelmer
