Dear valued member!
This is a letter from United Medical Research Organization. We just wanted to ask you to be as attentive as possible when buying drugs on the Web.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Please, be more discerning when choosing your Web pharmacy.Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Kent Ledford
USDrugs B.V.
