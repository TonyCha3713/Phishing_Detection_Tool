  it in a bank here in Cotonou.

Now the Present Government of President Yayi Boni has accused and arrested all
key Politicians who Worked under the past president of Mr Mathieu Kerekou for
Siphonning Funds.

Mr Anthony Effam is now being detained for probing,with this,he confided in me
as his Lawyer to get a relaible foreign partner whom the fund can be  transfer
to his account for safe keeping to avoid the present Government of Yayi Boni not
to locate the account for confiscation.

In the light of the above,im contacting you to know if you can provide an
account where the said fund can be transferred for safe keeping pending when he
is released from detaintion.

I have his conscent to discuss or negotiate with you for your share for keeping
the fund in your possession.

you are willing to accept the transaction or not.   Please keep this
  very confidential.

Your respponse will determine if i will further contact another person or not.
