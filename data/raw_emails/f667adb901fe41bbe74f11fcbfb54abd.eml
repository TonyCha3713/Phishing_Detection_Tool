But then it doesn't match how we run the tests otherwise. =20

My point is that I don't want to have to constantly wonder:  what test
environment did we declare for this test, what test environment did it
get, and what is 'make testenv' giving me?

I really just want one setup, and I don't mind the extra smbd or member
server configuration if it ensures that all the tests run against a
consistent set of servers.

If we are only going to give the tests the environment they declare, are
we going to start up/shut down environments between tests?
