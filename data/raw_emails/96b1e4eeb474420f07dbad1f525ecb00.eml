Privet, my dear friend

It's great you are reading my letter! Because I wanted you to read
it! I want to find a second half in this world and if you want the
same, we can learn each other better and build wonderful
relationships, can't we?
All you need in a woman, I have. I am pretty, smart, I like to make
house cozy and comfortable, I like cooking.
You can ask me why I am still single then? I can say that men in our
country don't value women! Do you want to know me better? Find me 
here http://myheartinlove.com/searching

The best of luck

Leny P.

I've not used something like what you're suggesting to fix my system but
i've used a livecd god knows how many times to fix my system, boot,
chroot, and fix, has worked well enough for me in the past and i've seen
other gentoo users use the same to fix their machines.
