I'm updated the coding style guide.  It's based on what
emacs does using the Linux kernel style so I don't think
it contradicts anything we've already agreed on.

Indention & Whitespace & 80 columns
- -----------------------------------

To avoid confusion, indentations are to be 8 character with tab (not
8 ' ' characters.  When wrapping parameters for function calls,
alignment parameter list with the first parameter on the previous line.
Use tabs to get as close as possible and then fill in the final 7
characters or less with whitespace.  For example,

	var1 = foo(arg1, arg2,
		   arg3);

The previous example is intended to illustrate alignment of function
parameters across lines and not as encourage for gratuitous line
splitting.  Never split a line before columns 70 - 79 unless you
have a really good reason.  Be smart about formatting.
