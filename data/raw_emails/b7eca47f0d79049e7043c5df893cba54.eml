"This is a great thing! 

Instead of watching TV and gorging everything easy to reach 

I became rather more interested in doing exercise.

 Anatrim put me on the right path.

 I=92m in a great form now and there are lots of men around me!"

Amelia B., Boston

"I tried some passive weight burning, but almost with no result. It was=20=
difficult for me to hold back and not to eat something just at hand. 

Once I heard about Anatrim in the media and I rather liked the=20=
information.

 I had tried to use it, and my wife said to me I=92m not more a weighty=20=
man now, 3 months later. 

25 pounds have gone away and this is not a limit! 

And you know, it=92s rather hot in our bedroom now."

Rikky Martin, Chicago
