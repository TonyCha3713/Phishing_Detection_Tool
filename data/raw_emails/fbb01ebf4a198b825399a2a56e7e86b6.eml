Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network)  officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from  try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Dont try to play Russian roulette with your health  choose reliable Web pharmacies only!

As far as I know, though I haven't had personal experience with them,
the hp/compaq machines made after the two merged, aren't of bad
quality. It's the pre-merge compaqs that are garbage. I don't even
know if your laptop
is from before the merge, or after.
