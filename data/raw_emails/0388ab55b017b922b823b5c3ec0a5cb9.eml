<p><br>
You have the last chance to save your social life - I am not kidding!!<br>
<br>
I give you the last 72 hours to make the payment, before I send<br>
the video with your masturbation to all your friends and associates.<br>
<br>
The last time you visited a erotic website with young Teens,<br>
you downloaded and installed the software I developed.<br>
<br>
My program has turned on your camera and recorded your act of<br>
Masturbation and the video you were masturbating to.<br>
My software also downloaded all your email contact lists<br>
and a list of your Facebook friends.<br>
<br>
I have both the 'Info.mp4' with your masturbation<br>
and a file with all your contacts on my hard drive.<br>
You are very perverted!<br>
<br>
If you want me to delete both files and keep your secret,<br>
you must send me Bitcoin payment. I give you the last 72 hours.<br>
If you don't know how to send Bitcoins, visit Google.<br>
<br>
Send 2000 USD to this Bitcoin address immediately:<br>
<br>
35sfKMk8NVUtzGsqpWvfzgjdiS6wz961de<br>
(copy and paste)<br>
<br>
1 BTC =3D 3470 USD right now, so send exactly 0.583427 BTC<br>
to the address above.<br>
<br>
Do not try to cheat me!<br>
As soon as you open this Email I will know you opened it.<br>
<br>
This Bitcoin address is linked to you only,<br>
so I will know if you sent the correct amount.<br>
When you pay in full, I will remove both files and deactivate my software.<=
br>
<br>
If you don't send the payment, I will send your masturbation video<br>
to ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES from your contact list I hacked.<br>
<br>
Here are the payment details again:<br>
<br>
Send 0.583427 BTC to this Bitcoin address:<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
35sfKMk8NVUtzGsqpWvfzgjdiS6wz961de<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
You can visit the police but nobody will help you.<br>
I know what I am doing.<br>
I don't live in your country and I know how to stay anonymous.<br>
<br>
Don't try to deceive me - I will know it immediately - my spy ware is<br>
recording all the websites you visit and all keys you press.<br>
If you do - I will send this ugly recording to everyone you know,<br>
including your family.<br>
<br>
Don't cheat me! Don't forget the shame and if you ignore this message<br>
your life will be ruined.<br>
<br>
I am waiting for your Bitcoin payment.<br>
<br>

Anonymous Hacker<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. If you need more time to buy and send 0.583427 BTC,<br>
open your notepad and write '48h plz'.<br>
I will consider giving you another 48 hours before I release the vid,<br>
but only when I really see you are struggling to buy bitcoin.</p>
