While making a tarball would be easy, the person using it would  have to 
be sure they had the libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 shared library, which is 
from gcc 2.95. Luckily, Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora still carry this, but I 
doubt very much whether other distros do, and it would certainly not be 
trivial to build it.
