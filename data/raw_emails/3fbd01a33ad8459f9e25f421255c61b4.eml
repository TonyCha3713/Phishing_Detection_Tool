Restore your sex life, or just

Erectile dysfunction (ED), 

sometimes referred 



to as impotence, is the inability for a sexually active male to obtain 
and sustain an erection for sexual purposes. In the past, this has been 


very embarrassing for


 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 


and, in fact, there has been very
 little diagnostic testing or treatment



 options available until very recently.
