I used the tdb only for storage (as this is really a cache
entry) but should not expire.  The TRUSTDOMCACHE is not so
much a limited cache entry like the rest of wcache but it
more of an accumulation of information collected from multiple
enumeration requests.  Another tdb would simply clutter the
file system.

Also note that at least in winbindd_ads.c, the trusted_domains()
function no longer caches.






cheers, jerry
