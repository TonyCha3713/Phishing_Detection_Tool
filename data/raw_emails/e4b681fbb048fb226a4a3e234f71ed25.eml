I poked around and the only thing I could think of was
was to store the library versions outside of the Makefile
and read them from the file. For example,

  DSO_EXPORTS = -Wl,--version-script,exports/`basename $@ |\
	sed -e/@SHLIBEXT@/syms/`
  SONAME_VER = `grep $@ $(srcdir)/library-versions | cut -d: -t2`
  SHLD_DSO = $(SHLD) $(LDSHFLAGS) $(DSO_EXPORTS) \
	@SONAMEFLAG@`basename $@`.$(SONAME_VER)

and library-versions.in looks like

  # Makefile_target:major:minor
  bin/libsmbclient.@SHLIBEXT@:0:1

How about that?



cheers, jerry
