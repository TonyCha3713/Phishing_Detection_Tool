Not really. If code can sign stuff without me being aware of it that
pretty much invalidates the (already tenuous, since it assumes me trusting
the contents of the frame buffer) concept of a digital signature.

A secure piece of hardware puts the keyring outside of any code's reach.  
The key never leaves the hardware compartment. I have to mechanically
acknowledge a signing process. The cryto fob then falls back to the
default state: locked.

I'm pretty comfortable with entering my passphrase every time. This is not 
production key, as I usually access my home box via a SSH session, and SSH 
sessions are easily attackable with a model of your typing pattern. So 
don't expect me to announce my plutonium shipments via this medium.

I agree. Nevertheless, a number of people who use cryptography have their 
machines compromised.
