Lighter fluid had pooled under it and now pale-blue tongues of flame shot up between the keys. For a moment Paul thought it was more blood from her torn lip and then he saw the seeds in it.

Dmesg can also be very enlightening when determining the hardware in a
system. If you are using a kernel that came with your distribution,
then chances are good that most, if not all of the support for your
hardware is built as modules, and isn't statically built into the kernel.

Actually, if you have an ide burner, and are running a 2.6.x kernel,
then you don't need ide-scsi emulation for cd burning either.
