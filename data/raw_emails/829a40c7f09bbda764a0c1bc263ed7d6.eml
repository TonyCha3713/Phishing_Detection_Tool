Folks,

Based on some research by Jeremy, it appears that Windows Vista
was not thoroughly tested against CIFS servers in share mode
security.  (Jeremy can you refresh my memory here on the details?)

So I'm proposing that we start using this as an incentive to get
people off of security = share.  We can work around some of the
bugs but it appears probably not all and IMO we have more important
work to do anyways.

If anyone wants to be the official "security = share & Vista"
support developer, I'll be glad to drop the proposal and point
all the relevant samba@samba.org email to you :-)  Anyone?  Anyone?





cheers, jerry
