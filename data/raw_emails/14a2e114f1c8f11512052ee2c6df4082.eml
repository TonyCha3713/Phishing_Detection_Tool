"I think I am most surprised by the fact that we have become
the 1argest site on the Web for the buying and se11ing of
used cars, motorcyc1es and auto parts," says Whitman.
"So from Beanie Babies to Beamers, I'm not sure that anyone
wou1d have actua11y have predicted that."
And no one cou1d have predicted that within two years of our
origina1 story, the number of eBay users wou1d more than doub1e,
to more than 125 mi11ion wor1dwide today. Those peop1e are
buying and se11ing more than $1,000 worth of goods every second.
An Internet pioneer, eBay is about to ce1ebrate its 10th anniversary.
The company se11s a motorcyc1e every 18 minutes and an
SUV every 30 minutes. As many as 150,000 peop1e have 1itera11y
given up their jobs to create their own businesses se11ing on eBay.

Volker,

We should have better fallback code in this case to
detect failure and fall back to the winbindd_rpc methods.

My experiences are not quite the same as yours an Tridge's.
Centeris is making a living from selling a winbindd based
solution into AD environments and our experience has been
that the majority of the time, the domain environment is
setup correctly and the AD admins are pretty competent folks.

The reason why I'm opposed to reverting the "use winbindd_ads
whenever possible" is that if penalizes everyone who uses
Samba for the benefit of a few broken installations.
I'm a little surprised since you have been the main proponent
of getting rid of any distinction between security ads and
security = domain.

However, it there really has to be a way to deal with this,
I would have to vote for Tridge's patch.  As much as I
hate new parameters, at least this one would not change
the current default behavior which I believe to be correct.






cheers, jerry
