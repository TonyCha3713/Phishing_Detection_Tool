* jerry lobs one up for debate

The libmsrpc code in incomplete, suffers from bitrot, and has no
maintainer.  The pain of trying to keep in it the 3.0.26 tree
while moving to the PIDL generated server and client stubs
is unnecessary IMO.

I would like to remove it form SAMBA_3_0_26 and siable it
in the SAMBA_3_0 tree (but leave it in place in case someone
wants to revisit it after the migration to PIDL is finished).

COmments?





cheers, jerry
