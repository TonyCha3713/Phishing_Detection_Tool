History

Founded in 1855, Bates was New England s first coeducational college. Several of
its earliest students were former slaves. ref [http   www.bates.edu x65012.xml
 Race relations at Bates College ]  ref  The college was originally called the
Maine State Seminary and replaced the Parsonsfield Seminary, which burned under
mysterious circumstances inttp   books.google.com books?vid 0sJkkT9w7iRYiZPNsLPwM6r id LkEOAAAAIAAJ pg RA1 
PA771 lpg RA1 PA771 dq  22parsonsfield+seminary 22 as_brr 1] The Parsonsfield
Seminary was founded in 1832 by Free Will Baptists and served as a stop on the
Underground Railroad. Parsonsfield s Cobb Divinity School, founded in 1840,
merged with Bates in 1870 and eventually became Bates  religion department.
Therefore, Bates  religion department is 15 years older than the College itself.

As with many New England institutions, religion played a vital role in the
college s founding. The Reverend Oren Burbank Cheney founded and served as the
first president of Bates. He was a Freewill Baptist minister, a teacher, and a
former Maine legislator. Cheney steered through the Maine Legislature a bill
creating a corporation for educational purposes initially called the Maine State
Seminary, located in Lewiston, Maine s fastest growing industrial and commercial
center.

Cheney assembled a six person faculty dedicated to teaching the classics and
moral philosophy to both men and women. In 1863 he received a collegiate
charter, and obtained financial support for an expansion from the city of
Lewiston and from Benjamin E. Bates, the Boston financier and manufacturer whose
mills dominated the Lewiston riverfront. In 1864 the Maine State Seminary became
Bates College. The College consisted of Hathorn and Parker halls and a student
body of fewer than 100.

Nearly 200 students and alumni of the College and Seminary served in the
American Civil War  1861 65 , and only two students from Georgia fought for the
Confederacy ref [http   www.bates.edu x65012.xml  Race relations at Bates
College ]  ref . With Cheney s support, the first woman to graduate from a New
England college was Mary Mitchell, class of 1869. Cheney also ensured that no
secret societies or fraternities were allowed on campus. One secret society was
founded at Bates in 1881 and is thought to be responsible for a fire starting in
the bell tower of Hathorn Hall in March of 1881, but the society was not
sanctioned by the President or the College ref [http   www.bates.edu x65015.xml
 Class at Bates College ]  ref . By the end of Cheney s tenure, in 1894, the
campus had expanded to 50 acres  202,000 m    and six buildings.

George Colby Chase, a graduate of the Bates Class of 1868, succeeded Cheney in
1894. Known as  the great builder,  Chase oversaw the construction of eleven new
buildings on campus, including Coram Library, the Chapel, Chase Hall, Carnegie
Science Hall, and Rand Hall. A twelve inch reflecting telescope was installed in
Stephens Observatory on top of Carnegie Science Hall in 1929. Chase tripled the
number of students and faculty, as well as the endowment. The Cobb Divinity
School  Bates Theological Seminary  and Nichols Latin School departments of the

Guenther, If this was to allow name2sid to resolve a UPN, you
need to be careful since the cache name2sid method will store
the forward and reverse mappings when you really only want the
UPN -> SID mapping stored and allow the SID to always resolve
back to DOMAIN\name and not name@REALM.
