Another option for a development environment is microsoft's windows
services for unix:

If you want to use an ide, which uses mingw as the compiler, check out
dev-c++:

http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html

It's fairly accessible with wineyes, a bit more so after I created a set
file and key label dictionary for it.

As for a win32 tutorial, I found:

http://winprog.org/tutorial/

to be useful. 

Since we're discussing this on here, does anyone know of anything for
c/c++ that would abstract the win32 api a bit more, so it wouldn't be
such a chore to program for it, making it a bit easier to write win32
applications? Thanks.

Greg
