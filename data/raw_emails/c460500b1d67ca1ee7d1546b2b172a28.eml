My order arrived within one week in perfect condition. The pills are phenom=
enal! I only use half of a pill at a time, and sometimes the effect is stil=
l noticeable the next morning! I've even tried a third of a pill once (I di=
dn't split it very well) and I still felt the desired effect. Thanks for go=
od service and a great product! David Harvey, El Monte, CA

That patch doesn't look right. If winbindd_fill_pwent returns non-zero,

incremented by at most 1 every time the loop is run, it's basically the
same as writing:

while(1) {
