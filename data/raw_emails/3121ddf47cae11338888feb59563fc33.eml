Dear Subscriber ,

If you are concerned about Cholesterol, then I recommend you try Cholesterblock. 
It is a natural substance that works quickly and effectively without livertoxicity or other side effects. When you combine Cholesterblock with an overall plan of healthy eating, exercise and life style modification you now have a way of living that can be maintained easily and with very little cost for the rest of your lives. The American Diet is responsible for turning the US into one of the fattest and unhealthiest countries in the world. The immediate response by the medical community is too often a prescription medication. Taking 
a prescription drug with the potential to cause liver damage without attempting a nutritional/supplementation approach seems risky.If you take a prescription cholesterol medication, try Cholesterblock. Once you see how well it works for you, your doctor may let you reduce or stop your prescription. 
If you do not take prescription cholesterol medication, try Cholesterblock and perhaps you will never have to.

I've thought myself more then once that this would be a nice feature to
have. The problem with adjusting speech parameters as soon as the synth
is found while the system boots, is that you are doing so while
speakup is still sending text to the synth. So, if you're lucky,
you'll hear each and every change taking effect with quite a delay. If
you're not lucky, then you'll press a key combination too many times,
and will wind up with something that you didn't mean to end up with,
and that result may be worse then the default parameters.

Then again, I've been meaning to look at the speakup code in detail
for a while now, along with reading up on how to program the kernel,
but haven't gotten to it so far, and don't know when I will. Of
course, Kirk would be fully justified if he responded to this with "so
code it, and submit a patch if you want it."
