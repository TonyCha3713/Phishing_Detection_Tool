The blacklist of unreliable or simply fraud shops is updated every week. We strongly recommend to visit our site before buying any medical products online. visit us

Our site http://www.us-nma.com/

The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself.

Folks,

I've sync'd up the 3_0_release tree as of SAMBA_3_0_25 svn r23107.
The plan is to spend the remainder of today testing and release
3.0.25a tomorrow.  So if you had a problem with the 3.0.25 release,
please test the release tree and let us know what is and is not
fixed.  There are many more open bugs of course and we'll catch
those next time around.

Note that the WHATSNEW.txt is current wrt commit logs in this
