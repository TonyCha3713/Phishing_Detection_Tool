It seems poor Dan's offended by the language used on blogs, citing as

Yeah, it doesn't seem to be listed on the rc systems order page. I'd
give Randy, (RC Systems) a call Monday, and tell him you're interested
in buying one, and see what he tells you. If he's not selling them
anymore, (which would be a big shame), then I guess the trippletalk,
or the dectalk usb, (which does also have an rs232 port as far as I
know), are your only options for a new hardware synth.
