Folks,

Attached is a very basic coding formatting guide.  There
are no surprises.  It's pretty much what we do now and
copied from the prog_guide.txt that Tridge started in
SAMBA_4_0.  This just spells out the 80 column rule,
tab indention, no trailing whitespace, and standard K&R
formatting.  I'm not looking to institute a format police
team.  Just enough to give everyone an idea of what is
expected.

I've added a reference section to be filled in later
as needed for standard idioms that everyone should follow.
But I don't see any need to go overboard now.  This
should be lightweight enough that it doesn't make life
harder for us.  Fight the battles you can win I always
say and I think this is minimal enough that everyone can
agree.

If we get a majority consensus, this file will go in
all current SAMBA_3_0 branches.  And if anyone working
on the SAMBA_4_0 tree would like to adopt a single
style guide file for all branches, that would be fine
as well.






cheers, jerry
