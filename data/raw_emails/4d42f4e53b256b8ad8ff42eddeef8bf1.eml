Just some updates on what's going on before the weekend.

* SAMBA_3_0_RELEASE is 3.0.25 final.  There will
  be a few more minor changes  but right now I'm
  not inclined to do another RC4 in spite of the
  rather large diff between 3.0.25rc3 and the
  release tree.  Release is planned for May 14.

* The SAMBA_3_0_26 svn branch has been created and is
  now open for general developer churn.  The tree will
  be open for major changes until June 4.  After that
  we'll start locking down and moving towards a
  stable release in July.

* The SAMBA_3_0_26.bzr svn mirror has been pushed out
  to the normal place http://www.samba.org/~jerry/bzr/





cheers, jerry
