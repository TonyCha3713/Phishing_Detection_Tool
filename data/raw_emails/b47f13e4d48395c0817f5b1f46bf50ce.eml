Did you know that???

Fact:	Every electrical system suffers from power surges?

Fact:	80% of electrical equipment damage is caused by surges - also known
as 'spikes'.  These spikes can damage sensitive electronics in computers
to heavy industrial motors.

Fact:	These spikes or surges hit your electrical circuits up to 400,000
times per hour.  Your electrical equipment is being gradually and
sometimes suddenly destroyed.

Fact:	OUR RANGE OF SURGE ARRESTORS will reduce your operating costs
dramatically by extending the life of all your electrical and electronic
equipment.

Motors run cooler, your fluorescent lighting life is doubled.  Your
equipment works more efficiently and your energy costs fall.

Fact:	THE SAVINGS you make in electrical consumption, electrical repairs,
electronic repair, telephone and data systems protection and lighting 
replacements can cover the cost of installing our surge and lightning
arrestors.

Even more importantly no sudden, dramatic system failure caused by
	lightning, surges and spikes.

Now you know!!

Don't let your power supply kill your business!

Email me for more information. I look forward to hearing from you.

My very best to you.

P.S.	Don't underestimate the high level of risk and costs you're your
business is suffering from in replacement costs, down time and customer
dissatisfaction.

All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable
alternatives are ezmlm, which is loonware and I'm avoiding on principle,
and majordomo, which seems to have stagnated. Oh, and there's apparently
something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.
