"This is great! 

I stopped watching TV constantly and eating any food close at hand 

I became rather more interested in exercise.

 Anatrim made me take a step up.

 Im more fit now and lots of men fix their eyes on me!"

Maria H., Colorado

"I tried some passive weight reducing, you know, but with little result. It was difficult for me to hold back and not to eat something just at hand. 

One day I heard about Anatrim in the commercial and I rather liked the information.

 I had attempted using it, and my wife told me I had changed for the better since then, 3 months later. 

34 pounds have gone away and this is still far to an end! 

And you know, the bedroom thing is cool, too."

Rikky Martin, Bellevue WA

Here's a rough patch for expanding domain group membership
in the winbindd_getgrnam() call.  Couple of comments:

* Adds "winbind expand groups" parameter which defines the
  max depth winbindd will expand group members.  The default
  is the current behavior of one level of expansion.
* The entire getrgnam() interface should be async.  I
  haven't done that.
* Refactors the domain users hack in fill)grent_mem() into
  its own function.

Comments?  I'd like to check this in for 3.0.26 as a
preliminary implementation for people that need it.



cheers, jerry
