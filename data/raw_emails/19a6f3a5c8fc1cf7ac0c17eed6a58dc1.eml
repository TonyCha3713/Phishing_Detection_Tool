Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network)  officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
If you prefer shopping for meds on the Internet, remember three basic tips on how to choose a reliable e-shop:1)      the pharmacy should be well-known (for example, USDrugs)2)      it should be licensed3)      the drugs offered should be generic
Please, dont be indifferent to the questions of your own health  choose qualitative meds!

If you have any more questions please contact to me.

Right, and based on what he's told us thus far, you and I were assuming
the same thing. Like I said, assuming his ethernet card gets an IP
assigned to it, (I.E. he configures a static one manually), he can
then ping that ip to see if the card itself works. I was also pointing
out however that pinging his loopback interface as you describe
wouldn't help him in solving his ethernet card problems. One could
ping the loopback interface even without a ethernet card or modem
installed in the system, and one would still get responses to the ping
from the loopback interface.
