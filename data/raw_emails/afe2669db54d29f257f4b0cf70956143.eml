This will only be the case if you're recompiling a kernel source tree
again. When you untar a fresh kernel source for the first time, the /usr/src/linux/.config
file won't exist. You can however move another .config file to
/usr/src/linux/.config, if you want to start with whatever is already
configured in that .config file, instead of starting completely from
scratch. Personally, when building a new kernel for a new machine, I
grab a .config file for the kernel/distro I'm already using, and
change that to suit my needs, instead of starting from scratch.

Actually, as far as I know, and this is what I've always done, you're
supposed to untar the kernel, patch with speakup, run make mrproper
clean, then copy a .config file
into place if any. Also, if you're just
building a freshly untared kernel from kernel.org without speakup, or
any other patches, you don't need to do make mrproper, I never did
that in those cases.

Before doing make oldconfig, make sure you have an existing
/usr/src/linux/.config, or /boot/config-2.6.21.5, if compiling a
2.6.21.5 kernel. If you don't have either of these, make oldconfig
will just use the defaults for your architecture. For the x86
architecture, this is /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/defconfig.

Note that you don't need to run make dep if building a 2.6.x kernel.

> make bzImage

If running debian, and if you've got kernelpackage installed, doing

make-kpkg kernel_image

at this point will run the 2 above make commands for you, and build a
package that you can install. When installing that package, it may
also install the kernel in the boot loader for you as well. Other
distros may have a similar shortcut.
