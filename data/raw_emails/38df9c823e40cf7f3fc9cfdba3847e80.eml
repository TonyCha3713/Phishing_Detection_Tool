FACT: In a recent survey by Durex Condoms, 67% of all women admitted that they are unhappy with their partner's penis size. This proves that size really does matter. Women view men with a larger penis size as being more sexually attractive and sexually capable. An overall larger penis size also means a larger surface area, which stimulates more nerve endings, resulting in a more pleasurable experience for both you and your partner. A larger and more muscular penis is also more of a natural, visual turn on for women.
