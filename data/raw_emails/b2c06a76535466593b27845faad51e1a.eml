Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Hope that this letter would be useful for you, your friends and relatives.

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

What off topic posts are you talking about? I don't recall having seen
any off topic posts recently.

As for the ubuntu/orca/newby questions posts, this still deals with
gnu/linux. As far as I know, Kirk's policy has always been that
anything gnu/linux related goes. Unless Kirk has changed this
recently, all the recent ubuntu/orca/newby posts would seem to be
along those lines. Now, if Kirk has changed this recently, then you'd
be right that this is OT. My apologies to Kirk of course if anything
I've said here is out of line.
