What is more realistic about such a test environment? It's just more
complex than the current test environments and can make debugging harder
as there are more factors involved than can cause problems.

Things will still be where they are. I just don't see why you would be
interested in $RANDOM-DOMAIN-MEMBER when you're running a couple of SAMR
tests against a DC.

My point is, that is also complexity. Not much, but the same thing could
be said for multiple test environments.

Like you use 'make testenv', I use "make test TESTS=<NAME>" all the
time. It's very annoying if I have to wait not 10 but 20 or even 30
seconds for provisioning to finish.

I don't mind 'make testenv' setting up more than one environment so you
can do more ad-hoc testing/debugging. Or perhaps having 'make testenv'
set up all environments, while 'make testenv-dc' or 'make
testenv-member' set up just one.

Cheers,
