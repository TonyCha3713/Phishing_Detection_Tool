ok.  So let me ask this.  I understand that you wanted to be able to
to be able to look up both the unix and ntgroup names in the group
mapping tables.  But I'm pretty sure that we decided not to do
this in the 3.0.23 changes and just require the mapped named
in things like "valid users".

So my question is, "Do you still think your change is necessary?"
it only exists in the SAMBA_3_0 tree btw.
