Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.








Erectile dysfunction (ED), 

sometimes referred 


to as impotence, is the inability 

for a sexually active male to obtain 
and sustain an erection for sexual


 purposes. In the past, this has been 
very embarrassing for
 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 



and, in fact, there has been very

 little diagnostic testing or treatment


 options available until very recently.
