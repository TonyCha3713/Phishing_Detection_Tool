Fortunately, I haven't had to do anything like this, so what I'm
about to describe hasn't been tested by me. However, your friend
should be able to boot from a rescue cd of some sort, make sure that
she's root on that cd, and mount her / partition somewhere. Then,
chroot into that mount, and issue passwd. Like I said, I haven't done
this myself, but it should work.
