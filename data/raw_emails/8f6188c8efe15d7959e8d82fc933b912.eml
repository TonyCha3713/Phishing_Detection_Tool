Ok, it seems like we've got some confusion when it comes to netmasks with
standard dhcp query addresses. The log snipit he posted said nothing
at all about the netmask, and no, 255.255.255.255 isn't the netmask
he's using, (never mind the fact it isn't a netmask to begin with, at
least not for a class c address).
