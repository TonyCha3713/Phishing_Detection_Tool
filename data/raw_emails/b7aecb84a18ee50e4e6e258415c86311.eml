Genuine Swiss made Rolex replicas are as close to the real thing 
as a replica watch can be.
Not always even the professional jewelers are incapable to tell the difference from the real Rolex watch.  
All original Swiss Rolex Replicas should have the following: Full 1-year Warranty 
   Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
   Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models 
   Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better 
  at resisting scratches than regular glass.
   The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If the retail dealer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!REPLICA \/\/atches BAZAAR!

I tried the ubuntu live cd, and was considering putting it on a system
to really play with, but this announcement has changed my mind. I
first tried gnome with gnopernicus back in 2002, and was very, very
impressed with what I saw when using the livecd with orca recently. Even though
great progress was made, I found that the gui access as it
stands now, still leaves much to be desired.

As for rolling my own kernel, I would usually do that on a system I
decided to keep installed, but not on a system I am just playing with.
