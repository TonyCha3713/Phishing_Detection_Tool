Dear valued member.
Its your therapists assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
No matter how wide the choice of meds is, always try to cling to generic ones. Moreover, it would be better to purchase them from reliable pharmacies, such as USDrugs. Dont forget that the pharmacy you shop at should be licensed.
Please, dont be indifferent to the questions of your own health  choose qualitative meds!

Hash: SHA1

When there is a tail call without parameters, the tail call frees the
caller's context without checking if it is referenced, e.g. by a
closure. The test in <parrot.tailcalltest.patch> fails in svn HEAD
because of this, but checking relies on the 'coincidence' that some new
allocated context is of the same size as the (incorrectly) freed
context. If some version of Parrot optimizes by default, the test might
succeed with the problem still there.

The patch in <parrot.solution1.patch> fixes the problem for me.

Why is the surrounding if statement (see below) there? If it was there
to detect that a closure was made and is now passed on to the callee, we
can remove it as it should not be necessary any more. That might fix
[perl #42790]: Tailcall with slurpy argument passing causes a memory leak.

315:            if (!(*pc == PARROT_OP_get_params_pc ||
316:                        (*pc == PARROT_OP_push_eh_ic &&
317:                         pc[2] == PARROT_OP_get_params_pc))) {
