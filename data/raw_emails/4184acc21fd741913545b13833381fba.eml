==============================================================
                                      Port 80 is the new HTTP.
                             -- Jeremy Allison on Web Services
==============================================================
Release Announcements
=====================
This is the first release candidate of the Samba 3.0.25 code
base and is provided for testing only.  An RC release means
that we are close to the final release but the code may still
have a few remaining minor bugs.  This release is *not* intended
for production servers.  There has been a substantial amount
of development since the 3.0.23/3.0.24 series of stable releases.
We would like to ask the Samba community for help in testing
these changes as we work towards the next significant production
upgrade Samba 3.0 release.

Major features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:

  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.
  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join'
    process.
  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and
    per domain backends.
  o New plug-in interface for the "winbind nss info" parameter.
  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of
    inotify on Linux.
  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS
    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side
    by side on the Same server.
  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including
    improved read performance with Linux servers.
  o Man pages for VFS plug-ins.


Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
===================================

Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating
domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
information.


New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
================================

The 3.0.25 release of Samba will include a rewritten IdMap interface
for winbindd which replaces the "idmap backend" parameter.  The
initial design document may be found at

	http://www.samba.org/~idra/samba3_newidmap.pdf

Please refer to the "idmap domains" description in the smb.conf(5)
man page for more details.


Dynamic DNS Updates
===================

The "net ads join" command is now able to register the host's DNS
A records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This
feature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate
when running the ./configure script.  There is also a related "net
ads dns" command for refreshing a host's records which could be
launched from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.


Support for Additional ACL Modules
==================================

Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer
which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations
on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.


VFS ReadAhead Plugin
====================

Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved
performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between
Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
module by adding the following lines to the share definition
in smb.conf:

[file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.
