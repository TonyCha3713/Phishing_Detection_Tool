I've thought myself more then once that this would be a nice feature to
have. The problem with adjusting speech parameters as soon as the synth
is found while the system boots, is that you are doing so while
speakup is still sending text to the synth. So, if you're lucky,
you'll hear each and every change taking effect with quite a delay. If
you're not lucky, then you'll press a key combination too many times,
and will wind up with something that you didn't mean to end up with,
and that result may be worse then the default parameters.

Then again, I've been meaning to look at the speakup code in detail
for a while now, along with reading up on how to program the kernel,
but haven't gotten to it so far, and don't know when I will. Of
course, Kirk would be fully justified if he responded to this with "so
code it, and submit a patch if you want it."
