Offroad Vehicle ServicesJune 27, 2:00 pm ET BAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- EX TREME Motorsports of 
California, Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) ("EXTREM E" or the "Company"), has 
completed the acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC ("SOVS"), a 
company dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road 
vehicles. Through this acquisition, EXTR EME will not only be able to offer its 
customers direct financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first 
sandcar manufacturer As previously announced, in exchange for all 
of the capital stock of SOVS, EXT REME has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million 
shares of EXTREM E common stock. Of the 15 million share of common stock, 10 
million will be restricted shares of common stock and 5 million will be 
free-trading shares.In the past, E XTREME required customer down-payments at contract signing and 
final payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required E XTREME to 
finance the 12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow 
of the company. Now, E XTREME will be able to achieve both greater throughput and 
profit margins by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has 
currently secured $14 million in financing for future customers of E XTREME, both 
for direct purchases and for leased vehicles. This will provide EXTR EME with 
immediate funding for the build-out of custom sandcars for private customers and 
"spec" vehicles for its dealers."The acquisition of SOVS provides EXT REME with the capability to deliver 
direct financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard 
over-the-road vehicles," commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of EXTREM E 
Motorsports. "Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar 
manufacturer in the world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. 
This not only ensures consistent operating cash flows to E XTREME, but 
incentivizes buyers who might otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to 
complete a purchase immediately through consumer financing."About EXTR EME Motorsports of California, Inc.EXTREM E Motorsports of California, Inc., operating under the trade name 
"Xtreme Motorsports," is a manufacturer of custom and production-line sandrails,
