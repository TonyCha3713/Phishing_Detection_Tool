Hi all.

Is it possible to include the speech-dispatcher/speechd-up/espeak
binaries in an initrd, so that one has speech almost as early as with
a hardware synth? If this is doable, and will provide speech
significantly earlier in the boot process, (especially if I were to
build alsa into the kernel itself), then could someone familiar with
how to work with initrds please describe the steps I would need to
take in order to accomplish this on a debian system? Thanks in
advance.

Greg
