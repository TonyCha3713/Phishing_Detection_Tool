Hi Andrew,

I just noticed the cli_credentials struct used by the winbind service in
the member server has some double elements under it. Maybe this is the
problem why we always do a new AP-REQ for each connection and the in
memory ccache doesn't work correct...

Can you take a look at this please?

struct cli_credentials  contains  502 bytes in 20 blocks (ref 5)
   struct gssapi_creds_container  contains 4 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   LOCALMEMBER3$@SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM contains 32 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   struct ccache_container  contains 20 bytes in   2 blocks (ref 0)
      reference to: struct smb_krb5_context
   struct creds_CredentialState   contains  68 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 1)
   struct gssapi_creds_container  contains   4 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   LOCALMEMBER3$@SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM contains 32 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 0)
   struct ccache_container contains 20 bytes in   2 blocks (ref 0)
      reference to: struct smb_krb5_context
   struct smb_krb5_context   contains   8 bytes in 1 blocks (ref 2)
   LOCALMEMBER3$           contains     14 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   SAMBA.EXAMPLE.COM       contains     18 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
   SAMBADOMAIN             contains     12 bytes in   1 blocks (ref 0)
