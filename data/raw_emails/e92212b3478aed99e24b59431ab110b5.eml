Folks,

While considering how a distributed SCM might work for us,
I've come across the need to potentially codify some formatting
rules to reduce on unnecessary diffs.  Two things that have come
up are

* The 80 column boundary.

  $ find . -name "*.[ch]" -print | wc -l
  995
  $ find . -name "*.[ch]" -exec script/count_80_col.pl {} \; | wc -l
  718

* Trailing whitespace:

  $ find . -name "*.[ch]" -exec script/strip_trail_ws.pl {} \;
  $ svn diff | wc -l
  221187

Note that I haven't filtered out the autogenerated code
(which I should).

Getting to any coding style standard is hard.  I've added a
copy of the Linux kernel Lindent script (script/format_indent.sh).
I not proposing anything right now.  Just pointing out
what I think is a problem as we attempt to grow the number
of developers working on Samba.





cheers, jerry
