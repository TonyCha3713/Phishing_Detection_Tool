Maybe that is true for the member server, but what happens when we start
adding tests for trusted domains, nt4-style dcs or involving one or more
samba3 servers?

The setup price also doesn't have to be paid when you're just running dc
tests - of which we still have plenty.

I think we're just repeating ourselves here - I'm not a big fan of a
kitchensink test environment.
