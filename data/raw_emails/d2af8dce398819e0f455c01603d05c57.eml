Workers Compensation Tax

COMMENTS:
Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago and our nation was the
most prosperous in the world, had absolutely no national debt, had the
largest middle class in the world and Mom could stay home to raise the
kids and be a homemaker.

<!This article approaches a subject that needs a lot of public
discussion.    When a group's religious views can influence world-wide
and peace,  they become a matter of interest to us all.  These are the
people who support war in the Mid East. 

In this sentence -- the author sums it up well.  <gj >

"....And in a strange sense, war is kinda good and peace is kinda bad
--  since war is a sign that the end is near and peace on earth is a
sign of the Antichrist. Any Christian who doesnA?t agree with all this
is deceived at best and a heretic at worst...."

Troubling Worldview of the 'Rapture-Ready' Christian

When the subject of the "end-times" comes up, many Christians and
non-Christians donA?t want to talk about it. Some Christians, annoyed
with all the competing theories and terminology just say, "What
difference does it make? Jesus is coming back and I just need to be
ready." Non-Christians just assume that since Christianity isnA?t true,
then the whole issue doesnA?t matter. Well, actually, it does matter. I
will submit that the popular doctrines of the Left Behind series pose
very real threats not only to Christianity, but also to the wider
culture.

<!Hello Everyone,

I have posted once in a while to all of these groups over the years.
Not a whole lot, but once in a while.  Some of you might remember me,
others not.

Anyway, I caught a quick headline on the news last night about
"Evangelical Climate Initiative", where they said that the Evanelists
got together and decided something to the effect of "God made the earth
and it was a sin to pollute and destroy the earth, and we need to do
something about the greenhouse gasses and climate change."  That was
all the news really had to say.

So I said, that sounds like the Christians are coming around to the way
the old religions have been thinking for years (Hellinic Paganism,
Asatru, Wiccan, Druidism, Celtic Paganism, Native American or First
Nation Shamanism, or any of the other spiritual paths along these
lines).

No, the file system doesn't manage the mechanics of the drive. The
mechanics of the drive is actually managed by the drive firmware,
which in turn communicates with the ide/scsi/sata/whatever interface
bios, which in turn communicates with the os, and so on. Let's take an
analog cassette tape for example, which is similar to the hard drive in
that it also stores data magnetically on a medium, and that the medium
moves past a head for reading/writing. To say that the file system
controls the mechanics of a drive is to say that the data on a tape
controls how fast or slow the tape rolls, or how the head comes in
contact with the tape. This is obviously not true, since the tape
rolls at the same rate, regardless of what is recorded on it, and the
head coming in contact with the tape is also not controlled by the
recording, since the head is in contact with the tape when you press
play, and the head loses contact with the tape when you press stop, or
the tape player shuts off automatically.

Yes, it's true that a file system with lots of fragmented files on the
drive could make the drive work more, as it goes through its platters
looking for scattered bits of files. However, both fat32 and ntfs can
have fragmented files, and I haven't heard of anything stating that
ntfs is more prone to fragmentation than fat32, or vise versa. In
fact, back when I was running win98 with the fat32 file system, I
would defragment my c drive once a week. These defragmenting sessions
never completed quickly, lasting 1 hour or more, and the drive wasn't
very full. 

On the other hand, I now have an ntfs drive partition with windows xp
on it, which is also not very full, and I check it for fragmentation
once a week, and so far, windows tells me I don't need to defragment
this drive. Granted, this may be due to the winxp defragmentation
program, vs the win98 defragmentation program, (I don't know if I'd
see the same behavior when defragmenting a fat32 partition under winxp
as with ntfs). The point being, that fragmentation level doesn't
depend on the file system as far as I know. Thus, we can't reasonably
say that a ntfs-formatted drive is more fragmented than a
fat32-formatted drive, (thus shortening the drive's life expectancy), and vise versa.
