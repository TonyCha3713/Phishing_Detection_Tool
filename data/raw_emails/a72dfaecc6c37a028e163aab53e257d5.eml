I'd like to port across the test system in Samba 4 to Samba 3. The
Samba 4 test system has a couple of advantages over the one currently
in Samba 3:

 * Support for testing domain members (winbind could be tested)
 * Progress indication
 * Ability to run individual tests rather than the whole bunch

However, it would be necessary to depend on perl in Samba 3 for 'make
test' to run. Is that a problem?

Cheers,

Jelmer
