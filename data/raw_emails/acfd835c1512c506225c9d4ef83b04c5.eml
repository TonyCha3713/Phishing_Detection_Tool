Dear customer.Many people say that saving money on medications is impossible without risking your health. However, our licensed CanadianPharmacy proves that it's not right."High price proves the high quality of the drug" That's what all Web pharmacies say in their ads. All except CanadianPharmacy. Drug sales tax is much lower here in Canada so we don't have any trouble dumping our rivals into tears. CanadianPharmacy generic quality CAN be cheap.CanadianPharmacy turn Canadian drug sales taxation system to your advantage.Yours,Cary Faulkner

I like the idea.  The pam_winbind.conf is a little long (and
prone to mistype). How about just "warn_pwd_expire = <num_days>"?

I think some of the lines are past 80 columns.  See the recent
README.Coding file in SAMBA_3_0.  I'll spend some time on Thursday
reviewing this more and hopefully getting it into the tree.
