I seem to recall your saying the p3 machine is a compaq. If that's so,
then it wouldn't at all surprise me that you're having issues, just because
your connecting another hd. My personal name for that brand is
comcrap, and I'm not the only one to feel this way. Check out:

http://www.compaqsucks.com

Yes, such a site really exists, and based on my personal experience
with machines of that brand, the content of that site isn't just
malicious propaganda.

I know this wasn't a concise answer to your problem, and one you
probably wouldn't have wanted to get if this is a compaq, but in
summary, if this is a compaq, I'm not at all surprised with the hd
problems you're having.
