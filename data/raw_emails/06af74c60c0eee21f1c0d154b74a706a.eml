I think the model we have in samba4 is really nice:
we have per subsystem private and public headers generated

But I think we can do better if we commit the public one's to svn
and don't generate them by the normal 'make'.

To keep information only in one place we should improve mkproto.pl
to also copy doxxygen comments into the proto header.
Then we should add a the need of on exlicit 'make
regenerate_public_headers', which will print out warnings about
changed headers.

I think this will solve most of the problems. It's impossible
to change public functions without human interaction and
private functions are as simple as they're now.
Also we will have uptodate comments in the headers without
risking cut-n-paste or laziness bugs of manually keep
source files and headers in sync.

I had also planed to a some diagnostic checks into the samba4 build
system, to automaticly check that the subsystem public header (
not only the public proto header) is self containing with the specified
public dependencies.
And it'll also check a subsystem links fine only using it's public and
private dependencies.
