 Why should you try Viagra?

Why Viagra? ...because that look she gives is only meant for you... because
an empty nest is the chance to fall in love all over again... because reading
the Sunday paper doesnt take all day.

If you have ED, youve already got plenty of reasons to choose Viagra, 
but here are some more that you should know about.

Folks,

Let's shoot for 3.0.25a on Friday, May 25, since there
are few issues that need to be cleaned up in 3.0.25.
This means all code needs to be checked in to SAMBA_3_0_25
by 7am (GMT-5) Thursday, May 24.





cheers, jerry
