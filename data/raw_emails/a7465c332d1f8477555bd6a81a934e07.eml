Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Recently, a research aimed at monitoring the quality of the drugs sold at the most popular online pharmacies has been made. The results of this research were rather surprising. Only one out of 53 Web drugstores  USDrugs  has proved its meds to be 100% generic.
Hope that this letter would be useful for you, your friends and relatives.

Right, and based on what he's told us thus far, you and I were assuming
the same thing. Like I said, assuming his ethernet card gets an IP
assigned to it, (I.E. he configures a static one manually), he can
then ping that ip to see if the card itself works. I was also pointing
out however that pinging his loopback interface as you describe
wouldn't help him in solving his ethernet card problems. One could
ping the loopback interface even without a ethernet card or modem
installed in the system, and one would still get responses to the ping
from the loopback interface.
