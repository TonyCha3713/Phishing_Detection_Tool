Dear valued member.
This letter is a piece of advice by IPN (Internet Pharmacy Network)  officially registered organization dealing with the problem of mass drug falsification.
If you prefer shopping for meds on the Internet, remember three basic tips on how to choose a reliable e-shop:1)      the pharmacy should be well-known (for example, USDrugs)2)      it should be licensed3)      the drugs offered should be generic
Please, dont be indifferent to the questions of your own health  choose qualitative meds!

If you have any more questions please contact to me.

I don't have any problems on Solaris.  The patch looks fine
but I expect that you have /usr/ucb in your path.  That's
known to cause problems.
