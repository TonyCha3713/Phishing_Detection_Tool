 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Folks,

As a small means of community service, I've decided to provide
an unofficial patched version of 3.0.24 (tagged as 3.0.24-gc-1)
to address the CVE-2007-2444, CVE-2007-2446, and CVE-2007-2447
security advisories.


The bzr branch is hosted at
  http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/samba-3-0-24-gc.bzr/

The source tarball is available from
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/people/jerry/3.0.24/

The Fedora Core 6 RPMS have been uploaded to
  http://download.samba.org/samba/ftp/Binary_Packages/Fedora/

This is it *not* an official release from samba.org and therefore
has been signed with my GPG private key (ID D83511F6).  The
security issues have been officially fixed in Samba 3.0.25
upgrade release.  However, if you don't want to make the jump
to 3.0.25 just yet, this 3.0.24 based snapshot might be just
for you.




cheers, jerry

ATTENTION
=========

The Samba 3.0.24-gc-X releases are not official samba.org releases.
They are cut from a privately maintained branch which can be found
at http://people.samba.org/bzr/jerry/samba-3-0-24-gc.bzr/
This is done as a service to community to include backported fixes
to the Samba 3.0.24 release in case people do not wish to upgrade.

The 3.0.24-gc-X tree is not an active development tree but rather
a stable release branch similar to the Linux kernel 2.6.xx.yy releases.
My hope is that this will be helpful to some people.

More information about Samba.org official production releases
may be found at http://www.samba.org/.


cheers, jerry
