Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
The drugs you purchase on the Web are in many ways similar to a time bomb  malicious elements found in low-quality meds accumulate in human organism damaging the organs they should be curing. Our Association recommends you to buy your drugs from USDrugs pharmacy since its one of very few e-shops selling ONLY generic drugs.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!

Folks,

The 3.0.25rc2 release is the final tarball which will be
a complete copy of SAMBA_3_0_25.  I'll be cherry picking
only the critical releases for the 3.0.25-final.

We'll see how things go this week at SambaXP with regards
to getting 3.0.25 released.




cheers, jerry
