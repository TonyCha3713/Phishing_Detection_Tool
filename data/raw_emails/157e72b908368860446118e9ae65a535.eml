 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

That's the whole point of that rule, to drop incoming pings. As for
the outgoing pings, that depends on how your outgoing chain is setup,
or possibly on if your ISP is blocking outgoing pings or not.
