Hello. I'm not sure if this is useful to anyone, but I wanted to throw
it out just in case.
The scroll lock, under Linux at least, can be used for its intended
purpose - to freeze the screen. If scroll lock is on, anything written
to your terminal will be suspended. When you turn it back off again, any
newly written text will start to be written. In a shell at least, you
can press control-s and control-q to get the same affect, most of the
time, unless another program has redefined them. Useful on remote
systems.
