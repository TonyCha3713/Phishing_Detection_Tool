 Always be ready! 

If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, you are not alone.
In fact, more than half of all men over forty have difficulties getting
or maintaining an erection. This condition, called erectile dysfunction
(ED), occurs with younger and older men as well, but there's a safe, effective
and easy method of treatment: Viagra. When the time is right, you'll always
be ready.
