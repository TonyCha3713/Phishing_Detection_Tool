Hi Herman,

here is my situation right now:  The GenericVolumeAdd and
GenericVolumeMultiply settings in /etc/speech-dispatcher/modules/espeak-generic.conf are both 100.
Also, I have turned debugging on in espeak-generic.conf so I can see
what is going on with the module.

If I type:
espeak "This is a test."
then
spd-say "This is a test."
the second time is much louder than the first, and should not be since
the default volume is supposed to be the same.

Looking further into this, I find from /var/log/speech-dispatcher.log:

 Sun Jun  3 15:21:25 2007 [765657]: child: synth command = |echo "This is a test." | espeak -w /tmp/espeak.wav -v en -s 160 -a 200 -p 50 --stdin && aplay /tmp/espeak.wav|

 Notice the "-a 200" on the espeak command line above.
 Speech-dispatcher is setting the espeak volume to maximum, which is not
 what I would expect with those settings.

Thanks,
