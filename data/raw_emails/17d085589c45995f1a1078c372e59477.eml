I believe that the MIDI files can be distributed under the GPL. I mean,
if you use a non-free IDE to write a program, would the GPL restrict you
from distributing your code under it? I doubt it.

As long as the MIDI files don't need the original (Shareware) program to
play you should be fine distributing it under the GPL.

But don't act just on me, wait until someone confirms this; I don't have
much experience in debian-legal, so I may be wrong.
