I'm in full agreement with you there. I will personally not buy a usb
synth, until I know that the manufacturer has released the specs for
it without requiring an NDA to be signed.

I agree there with you also. Granted, once you have an installed
distro, hardware speech isn't that vital. However, installation is
still a big issue in that department. Yes, gentoo, fedora, can be
installed over ssh. Grml, ubuntu can be installed with software
speech. However, what if someone wants to install and use a distro
like debian or slackware, that support neither option as far as I
know? Yes, I suppose that one could use the grml livecd to install
debian via debootstrap, however that procedure isn't for everyone,
especially for a newby. So, the fact remains that until it is possible
to install most distros either over the network or via software
speech, hardware speech is still necessary.

As for kernel-based screen readers not being usable during boot with
software speech, the same is true for user space-based screen readers,
such as jupiter for example, that would be using either hardware or
software speech. So, arguably, kernel-based screen readers still very
much have their own advantages, assuming one has access to a hardware
synth of course, though I admit that advantage will become less, and
less important as everyone moves to software speech eventually.
