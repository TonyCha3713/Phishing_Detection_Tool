> Here's a rough patch for expanding domain group membership
> in the winbindd_getgrnam() call.  Couple of comments:
> 
> * Adds "winbind expand groups" parameter which defines the
>   max depth winbindd will expand group members.  The default
>   is the current behavior of one level of expansion.
> * The entire getrgnam() interface should be async.  I
>   haven't done that.
> * Refactors the domain users hack in fill)grent_mem() into
>   its own function.
> 
> Comments?  I'd like to check this in for 3.0.26 as a
> preliminary implementation for people that need it.
