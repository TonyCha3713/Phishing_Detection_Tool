Dear customer.This is the letter from the CanadianPharmacy. We prove that "generic" doesn't necessarily mean "expensive". If you shop for drugs online, please, read this to the end.Everyone knows that drug sale taxes are much lower in Canada than in the USA that's why many Americans choose to purchase their medications at CanadianPharmacy. A much lower price for drugs of the same generic quality that's what CanadianPharmacy has to offer you.CanadianPharmacy time to save a lot without running any risks.Yours,Kimberly Sams
