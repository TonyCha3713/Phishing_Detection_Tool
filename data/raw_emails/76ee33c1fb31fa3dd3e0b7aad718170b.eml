Mind describing the procedure you took, (I.E. what vmware programs to
download, since there is a player and server), and everything that you
did? Is running gnu/linux in vmware with windows as the host really a
viable alternative to resizing existing partitions, and dealing with
installing on machines with no serial ports? Thanks.
