The common ways of online cheating are:
- delivery of low quality or fraud products.
- an enormous delay (up to 2-3 months) in delivery of products.
- shops obtain all the credit cards numbers and other credit information and then simply send nothing.
- shops sell unlicensed products they know nothing or very little about.
- shops themselves don't have a license to sell the pharmaceuticals.

Please check our blacklist of unreliable and fraud shops before buying any medical products online!!! Protect your family and yourself.

Mainly I've found getpwnam() and getgrnam() to be the main
offenders due to the fact that the first thing we do to service
the request is to try to convert the name to a SID.

The code path for getpwnam() converts the name to a SID
and then call winbindd_getpwsid().  The winbindd_getpwuid()
converts the uid to a SID and then calls winbindd_getpwsid()
as well so there is only one code path to debug.
