Dear valued member!
Its your therapists assistant writing to you. I just wanted to give you some really useful advice on how to shop for drugs online.
Be careful when choosing where to buy your meds from  try to cling to pharmacies that have already made a good name for themselves, such as USDrugs. Always make sure that your online drugstore is a licensed one.
Please, dont be indifferent to the questions of your own health  choose qualitative meds!Please click here for more information.
With Best Regards,  Lakeisha Waller
USDrugs B.V.

Yeah.  I thought you might.  Want to use 3.0.26 as the hand
off point?  I'll keep rolling the Fedora packages in the
3.0.24/3.0.25 series (ass needed) and you pick up the
packaging/RHEL directory in SAMBA_3_0_26.  I'll do the
same for packaging/Debian/.
