22nd Infantry Regiment 
Good day,
 
I am Capt Jarvis Maxwell Reeves Jr, an American Soldier. I am serving in the US Army of D Company, 2nd Battalion 22nd,Infantary Regiment, Iraq.As you know we are being attacked by insurgents everyday and car bombs.I and my crew members discovered $650M USD in Saddam Hussein's palace in April 2003. We managed to move away a total sum US$25 Million dollars cash out from the $650M USD, mostly 100-dollar bills and was quickly flown out of the warzone and deposited in an undisclosed security company in U.A.E. You can click on the site for more details about the funds.

Unfortunately, the rest of my crew members have lost their lives to the wicked Iraqi insurgents. I therefore seek your partnership to assist me transfer these funds into your account and invest the funds without further delay.I will take 65% while you take the other 30% and 5% will be for expences, no strings.If you are interested I will send you the full details but my fear is Can I trust you?

There is a pretty good deal going on at Office Max if you plan on 
upgrading to Windows XP Home or Professional: 
If you purchase XP Home (upgrade or full version), for $50 more you 
get: 
Kingston 256MB PC133 SDRAM memory module 
McAfee Antivirus v6 
Spectra Cool-Cam (webcam/low quality digital camera) 
If you purchase the Professional version (upgrade or full), for the 
same $50, you get all the above plus: 
HP Scanjet 2100c color flatbed scanner 
Hi-Val 12x10x32 CDRW 
Then, you get a $50 mail-in rebate (no matter which version you buy). 
 So you end up getting all that stuff for free just for purchasing 
Windows XP! 
My wife went in, asked about the offer, and a few minutes later, had 
the upgrade version of XP Professional and all that stuff for just 
$50, plus the mail-in rebate to get the $50 back!  Not bad...  Even 
if you already have a scanner or a CDRW, they would make great gifts 
too.  :) 
For more info, go to http://www.officemax.com  and click on the 
"Windows XP Exlusive 10-day offer" link on the right-hand side.  The 
deal lasts until 11/03/01.  So if you were going to buy it anyway, 
you may as well get free stuff too.
