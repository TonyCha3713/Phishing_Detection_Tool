Right, and based on what he's told us thus far, you and I were assuming
the same thing. Like I said, assuming his ethernet card gets an IP
assigned to it, (I.E. he configures a static one manually), he can
then ping that ip to see if the card itself works. I was also pointing
out however that pinging his loopback interface as you describe
wouldn't help him in solving his ethernet card problems. One could
ping the loopback interface even without a ethernet card or modem
installed in the system, and one would still get responses to the ping
from the loopback interface.
