"I wake up at 6am to make breakfast and help my husband get out the door for work. 
I drive my daughter to kindergarten and son to his junior high, then the grocery 
shopping, laundry, house cleaning, my girl scout troop, perhaps a soccer game, 
cook dinner, help the kids with their homework, and hopefully squeeze in some quality 
time with my husband. I wake up at 6am the next morning and do an almost identical 
day. I don't know what I would do without Ephedra."

My initial thought is that we could either doa check
against a user right (in the NT token) or a simple
gid check (including a "swat admins" global smb.conf paramter).
I think the latter is a better solution since it doesn't
require a running smbd to begin with.
