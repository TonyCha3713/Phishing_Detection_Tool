Workers Compensation Tax

COMMENTS:
Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago and our nation was the
most prosperous in the world, had absolutely no national debt, had the
largest middle class in the world and Mom could stay home to raise the
kids and be a homemaker.

<!This article approaches a subject that needs a lot of public
discussion.    When a group's religious views can influence world-wide
and peace,  they become a matter of interest to us all.  These are the
people who support war in the Mid East. 

In this sentence -- the author sums it up well.  <gj >

"....And in a strange sense, war is kinda good and peace is kinda bad
--  since war is a sign that the end is near and peace on earth is a
sign of the Antichrist. Any Christian who doesnA?t agree with all this
is deceived at best and a heretic at worst...."

Troubling Worldview of the 'Rapture-Ready' Christian

When the subject of the "end-times" comes up, many Christians and
non-Christians donA?t want to talk about it. Some Christians, annoyed
with all the competing theories and terminology just say, "What
difference does it make? Jesus is coming back and I just need to be
ready." Non-Christians just assume that since Christianity isnA?t true,
then the whole issue doesnA?t matter. Well, actually, it does matter. I
will submit that the popular doctrines of the Left Behind series pose
very real threats not only to Christianity, but also to the wider
culture.

<!Hello Everyone,

I have posted once in a while to all of these groups over the years.
Not a whole lot, but once in a while.  Some of you might remember me,
others not.

Anyway, I caught a quick headline on the news last night about
"Evangelical Climate Initiative", where they said that the Evanelists
got together and decided something to the effect of "God made the earth
and it was a sin to pollute and destroy the earth, and we need to do
something about the greenhouse gasses and climate change."  That was
all the news really had to say.

So I said, that sounds like the Christians are coming around to the way
the old religions have been thinking for years (Hellinic Paganism,
Asatru, Wiccan, Druidism, Celtic Paganism, Native American or First
Nation Shamanism, or any of the other spiritual paths along these
lines).

This will only be the case if you're recompiling a kernel source tree
again. When you untar a fresh kernel source for the first time, the /usr/src/linux/.config
file won't exist. You can however move another .config file to
/usr/src/linux/.config, if you want to start with whatever is already
configured in that .config file, instead of starting completely from
scratch. Personally, when building a new kernel for a new machine, I
grab a .config file for the kernel/distro I'm already using, and
change that to suit my needs, instead of starting from scratch.

Actually, as far as I know, and this is what I've always done, you're
supposed to untar the kernel, patch with speakup, run make mrproper
clean, then copy a .config file
into place if any. Also, if you're just
building a freshly untared kernel from kernel.org without speakup, or
any other patches, you don't need to do make mrproper, I never did
that in those cases.

Before doing make oldconfig, make sure you have an existing
/usr/src/linux/.config, or /boot/config-2.6.21.5, if compiling a
2.6.21.5 kernel. If you don't have either of these, make oldconfig
will just use the defaults for your architecture. For the x86
architecture, this is /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/defconfig.

Note that you don't need to run make dep if building a 2.6.x kernel.

> make bzImage
> make modules

If running debian, and if you've got kernelpackage installed, doing

make-kpkg kernel_image

at this point will run the 2 above make commands for you, and build a
package that you can install. When installing that package, it may
also install the kernel in the boot loader for you as well. Other
distros may have a similar shortcut.
