 What is Cialis?

Cialis is a prescription tablet to treat Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in men.
Cialis is a treatment that goes to work fast - as fast as 14 minutes in
some patients - and works up to 36 hours. This allows you to respond to
sexual stimulation when the moment is right for you and your partner.

Hi Geremy,

The latest version of speechd-up in gentoo is set up to handle this and
could use some testing.  To get it, do the following:

echo app-accessibility/speechd-up >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
emerge speechd-up

Then add speechd-up to the default runlevel.

Please report bugs to http://bugs.gentoo.org.

Thanks,
