Idol contestants performing a song in a music video.
I was, in fact, watching American Idol.

Beat Box are causing riotous reactions among hipsters throughout the US =
and Europe. So, any world music fans out there planning on attending =
Bonnaroo?
Putumayo World Music is no slouch, and they've stayed on top of this =
trend by putting out the fantastic Gypsy Groove album to feed the need. =
