After a bit of peeking through the exmh tcl and playing with tcl a bit, I got 
the "catchup unseen messages before cur" procedure working.  Here's the code 
for everybody and the list archives in case anyone wants it in the future.  
Thanks to John R. LoVerso for putting me on the right track.  

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status "Clearing unseen up to cur..." red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Unseen $exmh(folder)]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem < $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    set pick(ids) $results
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

If you want to use this, stick it in your .tk/exmh directory, run auto_mkindex 
on it and add the following lines to your .exmh/exmh-defaults:
*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:        ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:         Catch-up all before current
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:         My_Mark2CurSeen
