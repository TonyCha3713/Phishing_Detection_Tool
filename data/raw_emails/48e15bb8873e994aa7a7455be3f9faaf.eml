Imagine      being  part      of    a   stable     organization      with    a sterling reputation   -    a place     where  the      Sydney  Car  Centre      is     an    integral      part      of      all that we    do.

Today     the  Sydney     Car   Centre    is   looking   for      an       industrious regional assistant to fasten  the     process     of     the  delivery of       customer    payments       to the       suppliers.

As       a  regional   assistant, you will  be  supposed to   operate     with      the   payments  from      those      customers,       based  in   your      country.

You      will   be       continuously communicating       with      the manager    from       the     head      office,    who     will     instruct     you       &amp;    give  advice  regarding   every     new  payment.<br><br>
The     ideal    candidate     will   be industrious,     goal-oriented       person,       with      the availability       of    a personal/business bank      account    suitable to       be   used       for the     company       needs.

All the related  expenses    you    might   have   (like     the      Western       Union/Money  Gram     chargers,      related    expenses  on    traveling)  are covered    by  the  company.<br><br>
