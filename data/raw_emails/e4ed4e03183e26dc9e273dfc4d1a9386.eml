Hi Parrot-Team,

I had forgotten to add vim-folding for POD in #43000 now it is present.
You can test it by issueing 'cd editor ; make vim-install', opening a
pir file and typing

  :set foldmethod=syntax

This enters syntax folding mode.

I have added all PMCs from library/PGE and library/Parrot to
MANIFEST.generated as well. If you install parrot with 'make
reallyinstall' these pbc-files have not been installed before.

Regards,

Kiwi
