Dear friend,
 
I am very happy to inform you that i have suceeded  in transferring 
those funds out of my Country (Benin Republic) with the help of a new 
partner from Osaka Japan,though it did not work as planned on your side 
due to one reason or the other.

I appreciate greatly your understanding and concern,especially the 
effort you made to assist me. In fulfiment of that I made an 
international Bank Draft of $850,000.00 USD in your name to compensate 
you for your past effort and attempt to 
assist me,

now contact my secretary  Mr Cyprain Agu  in my country he will assist 
you in having the Bank Draft,You will reach him through his  E-mail: 
address (dr_cyprain3@yahoo.fr) he will give you all the necessary 
assistance,
 
Best Regards,
