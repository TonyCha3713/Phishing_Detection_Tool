Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) ("EXTR

acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC ("SOVS"), a company

of SOVS, EXTREM E has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million shares of E 
XTREME common stock. Of 
the 15 million share of common stock, 10 million will be restricted shares of 
common stock and 5 million will be free-trading shares.In the past, EXTR EME required customer down-payments at contract signing and final 
payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required EXT REME to finance the 
12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow of the 
company. Now, EXTR EME will be able to achieve both greater throughput and profit margins 
by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has currently secured $14 
million in financing for future customers of EXTREM E, both for direct purchases and for 
leased vehicles. This will provide EX TREME with immediate funding for the build-out of 
custom sandcars for private customers and "spec" vehicles for its dealers."The acquisition of SOVS provides EXTR EME with the capability to deliver direct 
financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard 
over-the-road vehicles," commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of EXT REME Motorsports. 
"Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar manufacturer in the 
world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. This not only 
ensures consistent operating cash flows to EXTR EME, but incentivizes buyers who might 
otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to complete a purchase immediately

Hi Greg. Have you perhaps tried get file1.tar file2.tar? I have not tried this myself; however, I think it may be workable. As for how often Ncftp/Lftp will try putting before giving up, I 
think Lftp is more agressive than Ncftp. In fact, I have never actually seen Lftp time out a transfer because of a drop in net connection/etc, whereas Ncftp times out after a while. There may 
be a way to get Ncftp to wait forever; perhaps there is a setting somewhere to control the timeout value(s).
