Well, synths seem to be a love-hate thing, some people like a
particular synth, and others can't stand the same synth. I personally
have had my doubletalk pc for 9 years now, and am happy with
it. Hopefully, you'll consider your doubletalk lt to have been a
worth-while investment once you get it. As for a usb synth, you should
be able to use your lt under windblows at least via a usb to serial
converter, and they'll hopefully become useable under speakup one day
also, I mean serial synths via a usb to rs232 converter of course.

There is. Its called provox, and is under the gpl. Its author is on
this list as well. You can find it at:

http://www.mhcable.com/~chuckh/provox7.zip

and yes, it will work with your doubletalk lt as far as I can recall.

As for using it in dosemu, you most certainly can, provided you've
configured the serial port correctly in dosemu, but you won't need to
do that when using speakup, since speakup actually speaks in your
dosemu sessions as well. In fact, if you tried to use both speakup and
provox in a dosemu session with the same synth, I wouldn't be
surprised if you ran into problems.
