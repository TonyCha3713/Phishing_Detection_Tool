Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
So far, the experts of our Association has been dissatisfied with the quality of almost all the Web pharmacies that we have been investigating. Actually, the only pharmacy we can recommend you is USDrugs  the only e-shop were constantly monitoring thus reducing the danger of drug falsification to the minimum.
Take care of your health  use generic drugs from licensed manufacturers and providers only!

no sorry, I don't have access, I also just see the build-farm output

maybe we should add a --enable-dependency-tracking option
