COMMONWEALTH ENGLISH THROUGHOUT THIS ARTICLE    

The  durian   IPA    is the fruit of trees of the genus Durio belonging to the
Malvaceae, a large family which includes hibiscus, okra and cotton. Widely known
and revered in Southeast Asia as the  King of Fruits , ref name Heaton   the
fruit is distinctive for its large size, unique odour, and a formidable thorn 
covered husk. Its name comes from the Malay word duri  thorn  together with
Malay suffix that is  an  for building a noun in Malay , meaning  thorny
fruit . ref   ref  ref   ref 

There are 30 recognised Durio species, all native to Southeast Asia and at least
nine of which produce edible fruit. ref name ACIAR   ref  Durio zibethinus is
the only species available in the international market  other species are sold
in their local region.

The fruit can grow up to 30 centimetres  12 in  long and 15 centimetres  6 in 
in diameter, ref name Brown   ref name Morton   and typically weighs one to
three kilograms  2 to 7 lbs . ref name Brown   Its shape ranges from oblong to
round, the colour of its husk green to brown and its flesh pale yellow to red,
depending on species. ref name Brown   The hard outer husk is covered with
sharp, prickly thorns, while the edible custard like flesh within emits the
strong, distinctive odour, which is regarded as either fragrant or overpowering
and offensive. The taste of the flesh has been described as nutty and sweet.

Species  For the complete list of known species of Durio, see [[List of Durio
species]].


Durian trees are relatively large, growing up to 25 ndash 50 nbsp metres
 80 ndash 165 ft  in height, depending on species. The leaves are evergreen,
opposite, elliptic to oblong and 10 ndash 18 nbsp centimetres  4 ndash 7 in 
long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large
branches and the trunk, each flower having a calyx  sepals  and 5  rarely 4 or
6  petals. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods each
year, although the timing of these varies depending on species, cultivars and
localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The
durian fruit, which can hang from any branch, matures in about three months
after pollination. Among the thirty known species of Durio, so far nine species
have been identified to produce edible fruits  D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D.
grandiflorus, D. graveolens, [[Durio kutejensis/D. kutejensis]], D. lowianus, D.
macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum. However, there are many species for
which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, and other species
with edible fruit may exist. ref name Brown   ref 


D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and
   available outside of its native region. Since this species is open 
   pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size
   of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers
   to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether
   this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian
   that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling
   like the civet. ref   ref 

Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious nectar, and give off a heavy,
sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers which are
pollinated by certain species of bats while they eat nectar and
pollen. ref   ref  According to a research conducted in Malaysia during 1970s,
durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats
 [[Eonycteris/Eonycteris spelaea]] . ref name Brown   However, a more recent
research done in 1996 indicated that two species, D. grandiflorus and D.
oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters  Nectariniidae  and that the other
species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as
bats. ref   ref 

Cultivars


Numerous cultivars  also called  clones   of durian have arisen in southeastern
Asia over the centuries. They used to be grown from seeds with superior quality,
but are now propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting,
including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U grafting onto seedlings of random
rootstocks. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by
variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines. ref name Brown  
Durian consumers do express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch
higher prices in the market. ref   ref 

Most cultivars have both a common name and also a code number starting with  D .
For example, some popular clones are Kop  D99 , Chanee  D123 , Tuan Mek Hijau
 D145 , Kan Yao  D158 , Mon Thong  D159 , Kradum Thong, and with no common name,
D24. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of D.
zibethinus exist in Thailand, Chanee being the most preferred rootstock due to
its resistance to infection by [[Phytophthora palmivora]]. Among all the
cultivars in Thailand, though, only four see large scale commercial cultivation 
Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong, and Kan Yao. There are more than 100 registered
cultivars in Malaysia and many superior cultivars have been identified through
competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture and
Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been done through
competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute.
