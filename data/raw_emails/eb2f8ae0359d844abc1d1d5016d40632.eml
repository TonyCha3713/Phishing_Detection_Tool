<br>the logins. We now need you to re-confirm your account information to us.
<br>If this is not completed by December 07, 2008, we will be forced to suspend
<br>your account indefinitely, as it may have been used for fraudulent purposes.
<br>We thank you for your cooperation in this manner. To confirm your Account
