without  hyphens; it treats of fourteen or  fifteen different subjects, eachenclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here and there extra parentheses,
verbs. The German grammar is blistered all over with  separable verbs;  andthe  wider the  two portions of one of them are spread apart, the better theauthor  of the crime  is pleased  with his  performance.  A favorite  one isREISTE AB -- which means departed. Here is an example which  I culled from anovel and reduced to English:
   That was certainly winter temperature; the snow lay like a heavy shroud on all the dead valley, but the strange, blind instinct of a man who has lived close to the earth stirred within him. He looked at the sky and the mountains and put out his bare palm. I shouldnt be surprised if the spring break-up was near, he said. I guess this is about the last winter day well get.

I'm not altering the D-Bus API with this patch - it's just
some refactoring to put code in a better place. The Buddy emits a
GSignal 'disappeared' when it runs out of handles, which causes the PS to
emit BuddyDisappeared; this is as opposed to having the PS inspect the
Buddy to see if it has any handles left.
