I'm really just raising the discussion.   I think we just
need agreement.  We have too much code reformatting (based
on personal preference) in our patches.   There's been a
loose agreement on formatting in the past and I've never
been a big fan of Coding Style rules.  But as we try to
expand the developer pool, an unspoken agreement is insufficient.
