Restore your sex life, or just
 give it a little kick.








Erectile dysfunction (ED), 
sometimes referred 

to as impotence, is the inability 
for a sexually active male to obtain 



and sustain an erection for sexual

 purposes. In the past, this has been 

very embarrassing for


 men, and a source of anxiety for their partners, 
and, in fact, there has been very little diagnostic testing or treatment
 options available until very recently.







Viagra 
can help you!

Thanks.  I'll take a look at the latest files and check
with Christian about how to reduce diffs (in Debian and in
our tree).
