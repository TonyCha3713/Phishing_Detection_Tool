Hi  ,

I stopped what I was doing to let you know about this right away. So I'll cut 
right to the chase. Someone is making MORE money than us and I don't like it! 
While we are spending all day marketing our websites he is doing hardly any 
work and making INSTANT CASH.

I've got a secret source where I get 'high ticket' software products that I 
can buy each month. I've never wanted to share with you this resource because 
it's been so valuable to me.

But this weekend I found out that the owner (James Thompson) has been making 
MORE money than me just by filling in on line surveys. 

http://rustypromdress.com/c/892550/opytzwx27:fzomttrrqUCKarpoqqv00XCKasstwv4 

As you can see from the site, all that James is doing, is filling out surveys 
on line and getting paid $5-$10 each. Which isn't a lot, so until now I never 
really investigated it. This weekend I did take a look over his site and joined. I spent the last 3 hours working solid to see exactly how much money he was making. In the last 3 hours I have made: $477.83. 

I paid $97 to get this program, which although I have made alot of money today 
is a big outlay for anyone. By me sending out this e-mail James is going to 
make even more because you and I are going to buy the list of surveys to 
complete online. I spoke to James just now and have demanded that if he wants 
to sell any of these products to my Web Site Community then he must reduce the 
price to $39.95 for the next 24 hours. (This is you guys!)

If you go to the site and its still $97 do not buy it. I wanted to tell you 
about this offer anyhow, its up to James if he wants to reduce the price. 
(If he does then its a steal, you only need to complete 3 surveys from the list 
of about 10,000 he gives you to make your money back!) If he doesn't reduce it 
I will keep e-mailing him until he does for you to buy it cheap.

But they never stay undocumented.  They become part of Samba
urban legends.

Please remove the option.  If we don't absolutely need
the parameter, then adding it is bloat IMO.

I don't think using tdb as a workaround for a bug
in ldb in this case is valid even as a temporary workaround.
Either we ship ldb or we don't.  Sorry for being so hard
nosed about it, but I fell very strongly about removing
the "groupdb:backend" option.

I will defer to the majority of course, but no one else
seems to be voicing their opinion.




cheers, jerry
