We've discussed this a bit in the past.  Actually beginning
with the 3.0.15/3.0.20 jump.  We event tried 3.1.0 dev release.
Right now the major advantages of continuing with with the
upgrade release (nump the revision number) and letter (bug fix)
releases is the branch maintenance and vendor pickup.

I think we've found out (as have the kernel devs) that
continuing in the same tree can support both rapid development
and stable releases.

So I'm very happy with the current system.  But I'm open to
other ideas.  We cannot however bump the minor number just due
to large changes since we would end up changing the minor
release number every time we released. :-)





cheers, jerry
