Dear valued member.
If you are buying drugs on the Web frequently, please, read this letter to the end since it contains really important information for you.
Not all the meds offered in numerous Web pharmacies are as qualitative as you might wish them to be. According to the results of the official research made by our Association only one (USDrugs) out of 46 online drugstores analyzed offers drugs of true generic quality.
Remember! Taking generic drugs you will secure yourself against poisoning!

If you have any more questions please contact to me.
Please include all previous messages in your email's.

ok.  Gotcha.  I'll have to go back and look at the code again.
