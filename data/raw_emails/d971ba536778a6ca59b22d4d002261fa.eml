Here's the problem I hit:

getgrnam("foo") -> nscd -> NSS -> winbindd ->
  winbindd_passdb.c:nam_to_sid() -> lookup_global_sam_name() ->
  getgrnam("foo") -> nscd -> ....

This is in the SAMBA_3_0 specifically but in theory could happen
SAMBA_3_0_25 (or 26) for an unknown group.

The attached patch passes down enough state for the
name_to_sid() call to be able to determine the originating
winbindd cmd that came into the parent.  So we can avoid
making more NSS calls if the original call came in trough NSS
so we don't deadlock ?  But you should still service
lookupname() calls which are needed for example when
doing the token access checks for a "valid groups" from
smb.conf.

I've got this in testing now.  The problem has shown up with the
DsProvider on OS X and with nscd on SOlaris and Linux.

Comments?



cheers, jerry
